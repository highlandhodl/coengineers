# CoEngineers: 31 Days of Claude Code

**The Complete Course Plan**

---

## Course Vision

A 31-day immersive learning experience where students master Claude Code by using it. Every lesson combines a short video (context + demo) with an interactive slash command (hands-on practice). By Day 31, students ship a real project.

---

## Design Principles

### 1. Learn By Doing
- Every day produces a tangible artifact
- Students type, Claude responds, things happen
- No passive consumption

### 2. Video + Slash Command Combo
- **Video (5-10 mins):** Why it matters, live demo, context
- **Slash Command (10-15 mins):** Guided hands-on practice
- Two modalities reinforce each other

### 3. Progressive Independence
| Week | Claude's Role | Student's Role |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| Week 1 | Does 80% | Follows along (20%) |
| Week 2 | Does 60% | More initiative (40%) |
| Week 3 | Does 40% | Drives most tasks (60%) |
| Week 4 | Does 20% | Near-independent (80%) |
| Bonus | Assists only | Full ownership |

### 4. The Fictional Company
All examples use a fictional Scottish company for consistency and personality. Students work on realistic scenarios, then apply skills to their own work.

**Company:** Thistle & Thorn Distillery
- A craft whisky distillery in the Highlands
- Family-owned, 4th generation
- Expanding into direct-to-consumer and experiences
- Personality: Warm, proud, a wee bit cheeky

### 5. Required Tools
Students need accounts for:
- Claude Code (core - API costs)
- Obsidian (free - recommended for notes)
- Gamma (presentations)
- Google AI Studio / Gemini (images)
- ElevenLabs (voice)
- HeyGen (video avatars)
- Kling (video generation)
- Whisper (local transcription - free)

## The Fictional Company: Thistle & Thorn Distillery

### Background
- **Founded:** 1892 by Angus MacTavish
- **Location:** Speyside, Scottish Highlands
- **Current Owner:** Fiona MacTavish (4th generation)
- **Employees:** 12 full-time, 8 seasonal
- **Products:** Single malt whisky, gin, experiences

### The Challenge
Thistle & Thorn has survived for 130 years on reputation and local trade. But the world has changed:
- Direct-to-consumer is now essential
- They need content marketing (never done it)
- Their knowledge is scattered across notebooks, receipts, and Fiona's head
- They want to offer distillery experiences but can't keep up with enquiries

### Characters
| Name | Role | Personality |
|------|------|-------------|
| Fiona MacTavish | Owner/Master Distiller | Passionate, overwhelmed, traditional but open to change |
| Jamie | Marketing (new hire) | Eager, digital native, needs systems |
| Old Hamish | Head Cooper | 40 years experience, all in his head |
| Sarah | Experience Manager | Creative, customer-focused, drowning in admin |

### Why This Works
- **Relatable:** Small business, real problems
- **Rich content:** Whisky-making has processes, recipes, stories
- **Varied outputs:** Marketing, operations, customer service
- **Personality:** Scottish, warm, proud heritage
- **Stakes:** Family legacy on the line
