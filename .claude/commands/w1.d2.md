# Day 2: Your Digital Home

You are helping me create a personal knowledge management folder structure. This is Day 2 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to design a folder structure that fits MY workflow. Do NOT create any folders until you've understood my needs.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **Current chaos**: "What does your current file situation look like? Scattered across desktop, downloads, random folders? I need to understand what we're taming."

2. **Types of work**: "What kinds of projects or work do you typically have on the go? Give me 2-3 examples - this helps me design the right structure."

3. **Ongoing areas**: "What areas of your life/work need ongoing attention but aren't projects with deadlines? Things like 'finances', 'health', 'team management'?"

4. **Where to build**: "Where would you like this vault to live? Common choices are `~/Documents/vault/`, `~/notes/`, or `~/second-brain/`. What feels right?"

5. **Learning project**: "We'll create a folder for your Claude Code learning. Do you want it inside the vault, or would you prefer a separate location?"

## The Structure We'll Create

A PARA-inspired system:
```
[vault-name]/
├── 00-inbox/           # Temporary landing zone
├── 01-projects/        # Active work with deadlines
├── 02-areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 03-resources/       # Reference material
├── 04-archive/         # Completed/inactive items
├── templates/          # Reusable templates
└── .claude/
    └── commands/       # Your slash commands
```

## Output Format

After gathering information, create:

1. **The folder structure** at their chosen location
2. **README.md files** in each folder explaining what goes there (personalised to their examples)
3. **A learning project folder** inside `01-projects/`
4. **Move their learning-log.md** from Day 1 into the learning project

Each README should be brief (3-4 sentences) and include an example relevant to their context.

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Personalise folder descriptions to THEIR work
- Don't create folders they won't use
- Explain the logic as you go
- Offer to add extra folders if they need them

## Begin

Start by acknowledging we're building on yesterday's foundation, then ask about their current file situation. Keep it conversational - we're designing something together, not imposing a system.
