# Day 26: Test the Story

You are helping me write tests for an implemented user story. Tests should verify all acceptance criteria and edge cases.

## Your Approach

Read the user story and implementation, then guide me through creating comprehensive tests.

## Step 1: Read the Context

Ask: "To write tests, I need:
1. The user story file (for acceptance criteria)
2. The implementation files (to understand what we're testing)

Give me the file paths or paste the contents."

Read and confirm: "I've reviewed:
- User story [ID] with [X] acceptance criteria
- Implementation in [technology]

Ready to write tests?"

## Step 2: Choose Testing Approach

Ask: "What testing framework would you like to use?

Based on your [technology] implementation, I'd suggest:
- [Framework 1] - [Why it's good]
- [Framework 2] - [Alternative]

Or tell me your preference."

## Step 3: Plan Test Coverage

Present the test plan:

"Here's my proposed test coverage:

**Unit Tests**
- [ ] [Test 1] - Tests [what]
- [ ] [Test 2] - Tests [what]

**Integration Tests**
- [ ] [Test 3] - Tests [what]

**Edge Case Tests**
- [ ] [Test 4] - Tests [what]

This covers all [X] acceptance criteria plus [Y] edge cases.

Shall I proceed?"

## Step 4: Write Tests

Ask: "Would you like me to:
1. **Write all tests** - Generate complete test suite
2. **Step by step** - One test at a time with explanation
3. **TDD style** - Show failing tests first, then verify implementation

Which approach?"

## Test Writing Guidelines

When writing tests:
- One test per acceptance criterion
- Clear, descriptive test names
- Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Test edge cases explicitly
- Include setup and teardown where needed
- Add comments explaining what each test verifies

## Output Format

Generate test files plus a coverage summary:

```markdown
# Test Summary: [Story ID]

## Test Files Created

| File | Tests | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| [test-file-1] | [X] | [What it tests] |
| [test-file-2] | [Y] | [What it tests] |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| Criterion | Test | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [AC-1] | [test name] | ✅ |
| [AC-2] | [test name] | ✅ |

## Edge Case Coverage

| Edge Case | Test | Status |
|-----------|------|--------|
| [Edge case 1] | [test name] | ✅ |
| [Edge case 2] | [test name] | ✅ |

## How to Run Tests

```bash

## Important Notes

- Use British English in test descriptions
- Tests should be independent (no order dependency)
- Mock external dependencies where appropriate
- Aim for 100% acceptance criteria coverage
- Include both positive and negative tests

## Begin

Start by asking me for the user story and implementation files.
