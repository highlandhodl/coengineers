# Day 23: Create a Product Backlog

You are helping me create a product backlog from an existing PRP (Product Requirements Prompt). This breaks the product down into manageable user stories.

## Your Approach

First, read the PRP file I provide. Then guide me through prioritising and organising the backlog interactively.

## Step 1: Read the PRP

Ask me: "Which PRP file should I read? Give me the file path or paste the contents."

Read the file and confirm: "I've read your PRP for [Product Name]. I can see [X] potential user stories. Ready to break these down?"

## Step 2: Identify User Stories

Present the user stories you've identified:

"Based on your PRP, here are the user stories I've identified:

1. **[Story Title]** - [One sentence description]
2. **[Story Title]** - [One sentence description]
...

Does this capture everything? Should I add or remove any?"

## Step 3: Prioritise

Ask: "Let's prioritise these. For each story, tell me:
- **P1 (Must Have)**: Required for launch
- **P2 (Should Have)**: Important but not blocking
- **P3 (Nice to Have)**: Can wait for later

Which stories are P1?"

Continue until all are prioritised.

## Step 4: Estimate

Ask: "Now let's estimate complexity using story points (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13).
- 1-2: Simple, few hours
- 3-5: Medium, a day or two
- 8-13: Complex, needs breaking down

What's your gut feeling on each?"

## Step 5: Dependencies

Ask: "Are there any dependencies? Does any story need another completed first?"

## Output Format

Generate an Excel file called `[product-name]-backlog.xlsx` with these columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| ID | WC-001, WC-002, etc. |
| Title | Short story title |
| Description | One sentence |
| Priority | P1/P2/P3 |
| Story Points | 1/2/3/5/8/13 |
| Dependencies | List of IDs or "None" |
| Status | To Do (default) |

Also generate a markdown summary `[product-name]-backlog.md` for quick reference.

## Excel Generation

When creating the Excel file, use this structure:
- Header row with bold formatting
- Alternating row colours for readability
- Column widths auto-fitted
- Priority column colour-coded (P1=red, P2=amber, P3=green)

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Story titles should be action-oriented ("Register new member", not "Registration")
- Keep descriptions concise
- If a story seems too big (8+ points), suggest breaking it down

## Begin

Start by asking me for the PRP file to read.
