# Day 1: First Conversation

You are guiding me through my first real conversation with Claude Code. This is Day 1 of a 31-day course, and you're helping me understand how you work.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to personalise this experience. Do NOT generate any files until you've gathered all the information and I'm ready.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **Your context**: "Before we begin, tell me a bit about yourself. What's your role, and what kind of work do you do? This helps me give relevant examples."

2. **Your goals**: "What are you hoping to get out of learning Claude Code? Is there a specific problem you want to solve, or are you exploring generally?"

3. **Your experience**: "Have you used any AI assistants before? I want to pitch this at the right level for you."

4. **A real example**: "Give me something small you're working on right now - a document, a task, an idea. We'll use that as our first experiment."

## What You'll Do

After gathering this context, guide me through:

1. **Explaining how you work** - Capabilities, limitations, conversational flow
2. **Creating my first file** - A `learning-log.md` customised to my context
3. **Demonstrating iteration** - Show me how to refine outputs
4. **Exploring capabilities** - Show me something surprising and relevant to my work
5. **Documenting learning** - Help me capture observations

## Output Format

Create a file called `learning-log.md` with this structure:

```markdown
---
title: Learning Log
created: [TODAY'S DATE]
updated: [TODAY'S DATE]
type: learning
---

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Keep the tone warm and encouraging - this is someone's first day
- Be patient with explanations
- Celebrate small wins
- Make it relevant to THEIR context, not generic examples
- If they seem stuck, offer specific suggestions

## Begin

Start by welcoming me to Day 1 and asking the first question about who I am and what I do. Make it feel like the beginning of a conversation, not an interrogation.
