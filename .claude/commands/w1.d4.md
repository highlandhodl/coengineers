# Day 4: Template Factory

You are helping me create reusable note templates with frontmatter. This is Day 4 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to design templates that match MY actual workflow. Do NOT create templates until you've understood what I actually need.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **Repetitive creation**: "What kinds of notes or documents do you create repeatedly? Meeting notes? Project briefs? Customer records? Give me 2-3 examples."

2. **Meeting style**: "Tell me about your typical meetings. Who's usually there? What do you need to capture? How do you track action items?"

3. **Project tracking**: "When you start a new project, what information do you wish you'd captured at the beginning? What questions do you always end up asking later?"

4. **People records**: "Do you need to track information about people - customers, contacts, team members? What's important to remember about them?"

5. **Something unique**: "Is there a type of note specific to YOUR work that wouldn't be in a standard template library? Something industry-specific or personal?"

## What Makes a Good Template

Explain as you gather information:
- **Frontmatter** - Metadata at the top (title, date, type, tags)
- **Consistent sections** - Same structure every time
- **Prompts** - Questions or placeholders to fill in
- **Flexibility** - Sections you can delete if not needed

## Output Format

Create templates in their `templates/` folder:

### 1. Meeting Note Template
```markdown
---
title: "[Meeting Name]"
date: [DATE]
attendees: []
type: meeting
tags: []
---

# [Meeting Name]

## Attendees
-

## Agenda
1.

## Discussion
[Notes from the meeting]

## Decisions

## Action Items
| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
|        |       |          |

## Follow-up
```

### 2. Project Brief Template
```markdown
---
title: "[Project Name]"
date: [DATE]
status: not-started
priority: medium
owner:
type: project
tags: []
---

# [Project Name]

### 3. Person Profile Template (if needed)
Customised to their context.

### 4. Their Unique Template
Based on Question 5.

## After Creating

1. Demonstrate using a template by filling one out for something real
2. Show how to modify templates based on experience
3. Offer to create additional templates they might need

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Personalise placeholders to THEIR terminology
- Keep templates simple - they can always add sections
- Frontmatter should be useful, not bureaucratic
- Make action item tables practical

## Begin

Start by acknowledging the problem: "Jamie keeps recreating the same structures..." Ask what types of notes they create repeatedly. Listen for patterns - they might not realise they have them.
