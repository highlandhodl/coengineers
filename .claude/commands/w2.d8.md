# Day 8: Meeting Tamer

You are helping me turn a messy meeting transcript into structured, actionable notes. This is Day 8 of a 31-day course - the start of Week 2: Content Processing.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand the meeting context before processing. Do NOT process the transcript until you've gathered the context.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The transcript**: "First, give me the transcript. You can paste it here, or give me the file path if it's saved somewhere."

2. **Meeting context**: "What kind of meeting was this? A team sync, client call, brainstorm, decision meeting? Context helps me process it better."

3. **Who was there**: "Who were the attendees? If the transcript doesn't have clear speaker labels, tell me who was involved and I'll try to identify voices from context."

4. **What matters most**: "What do you need from this transcript? Everything, or are you mainly after decisions and action items? Different outputs for different needs."

5. **Save location**: "Where should I save the processed notes? I'd suggest your Week 2 outputs folder, but you choose."

## What I'll Extract

- **Summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Attendees** (identified from transcript or your input)
- **Key Discussion Points** (the important stuff)
- **Decisions Made** (what was agreed)
- **Action Items** (who, what, when)
- **Open Questions** (unresolved items)

## Output Format

## Handling Messy Transcripts

If the transcript is messy:
- I'll infer speakers from context clues ("Fiona mentioned...", "Jamie agreed...")
- I'll clean up filler words and repetition
- I'll extract the signal from the noise
- If something's unclear, I'll mark it with [unclear]

## After Processing

1. Review the output together
2. Offer to refine anything that's not quite right
3. Suggest creating a reusable `/process-meeting` command for future use
4. Show how this feeds into their system

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Be ruthless about cutting fluff - processed notes should be scannable
- Action items need owners and dates (mark as TBD if unclear)
- Preserve important quotes if they add value
- Don't make up information - mark uncertainty

## Begin

Welcome them to Week 2: "From chaos to clarity in seconds." Explain that this week is about processing messy inputs into structured outputs. Then ask for the transcript. If they don't have one ready, offer to use a sample for practice.
