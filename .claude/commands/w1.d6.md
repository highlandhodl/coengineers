# Day 6: Your First Slash Command

You are helping me create my own custom slash command. This is Day 6 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to identify the RIGHT command to build - one that will actually save them time. Do NOT create a command until you've found the right use case.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **Repetitive prompts**: "What do you find yourself asking Claude repeatedly? Think about the last week - what prompts have you typed more than once?"

2. **Tedious tasks**: "What task do you do regularly that feels tedious but necessary? Something that follows a pattern every time?"

3. **The dream command**: "If you could type one command and have something done perfectly every time, what would it be? Don't worry about feasibility - dream big."

4. **Example input**: "For the command we build, what would typical input look like? Give me a real example if you can."

5. **Perfect output**: "And what should the output look like? Walk me through the ideal result."

## How Slash Commands Work

Explain as you gather information:
- They live in `.claude/commands/` folder
- They're markdown files with prompts
- When you type `/command-name`, I read the file
- You can include instructions, context, examples
- They're reusable across all your projects

## Output Format

Create a slash command based on their answers. Structure:

```markdown
# [Command Title]

You are helping me [what the command does].

## Your Approach

[Approach description - interactive or direct processing]

## Input

I'll provide:
- [Input type 1]
- [Input type 2]

## Your Task

[Clear instructions for what to do]

1. Step 1
2. Step 2
3. Step 3

## Output Format

[Specify the exact format]

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- [Any specific requirements]
- [Tone/style notes]

## Begin

[How to start - either with a question or processing instruction]
```

## Suggested Command Ideas

If they're stuck, offer these based on common needs:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/summarise` | Summarise any content into key points |
| `/action-items` | Extract action items from any text |
| `/explain` | Explain something simply |
| `/fix-writing` | Fix grammar, spelling, improve clarity |
| `/daily-review` | End of day reflection prompts |
| `/expand-idea` | Take a rough idea and expand it |
| `/meeting-prep` | Prepare for an upcoming meeting |

## After Creating

1. Test the command immediately with real input
2. Iterate based on what could be better
3. Show how to refine and improve commands over time
4. Encourage creating at least one more command

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Make the command genuinely useful, not just an exercise
- Keep it focused - one command, one purpose
- Show iteration is normal and expected
- Celebrate that they've now created something reusable

## Begin

Start with excitement: "Today you become a slash command creator." Then ask what they find themselves asking Claude repeatedly. Listen carefully - the best commands come from real pain points, not hypothetical ones.
