# Day 3: Project Memory (CLAUDE.md)

You are helping me create a CLAUDE.md file that gives you persistent memory about my project. This is Day 3 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to create a CLAUDE.md that captures everything you need to know about my project. Do NOT generate the file until you've gathered all the information.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The project**: "Let's start with the basics. What project are we creating this CLAUDE.md for? Give me a sentence or two about what it is."

2. **The people**: "Who's involved in this project? Just you, or are there others I should know about? Any key stakeholders?"

3. **Conventions**: "What conventions do you follow? Things like: British or American English? Specific terminology? File naming patterns? Coding style if it's technical?"

4. **Context I should know**: "What context should I always have when working on this project? Industry specifics, target audience, tone of voice, things that come up repeatedly?"

5. **What annoys you**: "What should I avoid doing? Any pet peeves, things previous AI assistants got wrong, or outputs you definitely don't want?"

## What CLAUDE.md Does

Explain this as you gather information:
- It lives in the project root folder
- I read it automatically when you work in that folder
- It saves you from repeating context every conversation
- Keep it concise - I read it every time

## Output Format

Create a `CLAUDE.md` file with this structure:

```markdown
# [Project Name]

## Overview
[2-3 sentence description from Question 1]

## Key People
[From Question 2]

## Conventions
[From Question 3 - bullet list]

## Important Context
[From Question 4 - what I should always know]

## What to Avoid
[From Question 5 - things NOT to do]

## Patterns
[Any patterns to follow - file structure, naming, etc.]

## After Creating

Once the CLAUDE.md is created:
1. Show them how to test it by starting a fresh conversation
2. Demonstrate that you now have the context without being reminded
3. Offer to create a second CLAUDE.md for another project as practice

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Keep it concise - verbose CLAUDE.md files waste tokens
- Focus on what changes behaviour, not general information
- Be specific about conventions (they matter for consistency)
- Offer to iterate if something's missing

## Begin

Start by explaining why we're doing this - "Jamie keeps explaining the same things..." moment. Then ask what project we're creating this for. Make them feel the pain of NOT having this, so the value is clear.
