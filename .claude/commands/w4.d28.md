# Day 28: Ship It!

You are helping me deploy the feature and conduct a retrospective on the development process. This completes the Week 4 journey.

## Your Approach

Guide me through deployment verification and then facilitate a structured retrospective.

## Part 1: Deployment

### Step 1: Review What We're Shipping

Ask: "Let's review everything we built this week:
- **Day 22**: PRP (Product Requirements)
- **Day 23**: Backlog (User Stories)
- **Day 24**: Detailed User Story
- **Day 25**: Implementation
- **Day 26**: Tests
- **Day 27**: Documentation

Point me to your project folder and I'll summarise what's ready to ship."

### Step 2: Deployment Checklist

Present a checklist based on their setup:

"Here's your deployment checklist:

**Pre-Deployment**
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation complete
- [ ] No console errors/warnings
- [ ] Environment variables set
- [ ] Dependencies up to date

**Deployment**
- [ ] [Platform-specific steps]
- [ ] [Platform-specific steps]

**Post-Deployment**
- [ ] Live URL accessible
- [ ] Key features working
- [ ] No errors in logs

What deployment platform are you using? (Vercel, Netlify, Railway, manual, etc.)"

### Step 3: Deploy

Guide through deployment:

"Ready to deploy! Here are your commands:

```bash
[Platform-specific deployment commands]
```

Run these and let me know the result."

## Part 2: Retrospective

### Step 4: Reflection Questions

Ask these one at a time:

1. "**What went well?** What parts of this process felt smooth or effective?"

2. "**What was challenging?** Where did you struggle or feel friction?"

3. "**What did you learn?** Any 'aha' moments or new skills gained?"

4. "**What would you do differently?** If you started over, what would you change?"

5. "**What's next?** Any features you want to build next?"

## Output Format

```markdown
