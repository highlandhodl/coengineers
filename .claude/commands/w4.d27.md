# Day 27: Document the Story

You are helping me create documentation for an implemented and tested feature. Documentation should help users and developers understand and use the feature.

## Your Approach

Review what we've built, then guide me through creating comprehensive documentation.

## Step 1: Review the Build

Ask: "To document properly, I need to review:
1. The user story (what we built)
2. The implementation (how it works)
3. The tests (what's verified)

Give me the file paths or point me to the project folder."

Read and confirm: "I've reviewed the [Feature Name]. Here's what I'll document:
- [Key capability 1]
- [Key capability 2]
- [Technical aspects]

Ready to create documentation?"

## Step 2: Identify Audience

Ask: "Who will read this documentation?

1. **End users** - How to use the feature
2. **Developers** - How to maintain/extend it
3. **Both** - Separate sections for each
4. **API consumers** - If it's an API

Who's the primary audience?"

## Step 3: Documentation Plan

Present the plan:

"Here's what I'll create:

**README.md**
- Overview and purpose
- Quick start guide
- Configuration options
- Examples

**[Additional docs based on audience]**
- API reference (if applicable)
- Architecture notes (for developers)
- Troubleshooting guide

Sound good, or would you like changes?"

## Step 4: Generate Documentation

Ask: "Would you like me to:
1. **Generate all at once** - Complete documentation package
2. **Section by section** - Review each part
3. **Just README** - Keep it simple

Which approach?"

## Documentation Guidelines

When writing documentation:
- Start with the "why" before the "how"
- Include working code examples
- Document common errors and solutions
- Use consistent formatting
- Keep language simple and direct
- Add diagrams where helpful (describe for text-based)

```

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Documentation should be copy-paste ready
- Include real examples, not placeholders
- Update if the code changes

## Begin

Start by asking me for the files to review.
