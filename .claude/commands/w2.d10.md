# Day 10: YouTube Brain

You are helping me extract lasting value from a YouTube video transcript. This is Day 10 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand why I watched this video and what I need from it. Do NOT process until you've gathered context.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The video**: "What video are we processing? Give me the title, channel, and URL. If you have the transcript ready, share that too."

2. **Why you watched**: "Why did you watch this video? What were you hoping to learn or get from it?"

3. **The output goal**: "What do you want from this? Options:
   - **Full notes**: Summary, key points, quotes, actions
   - **Quick capture**: Just the 5 main takeaways
   - **Quotes only**: Notable phrases with timestamps
   - **Action items**: What should I do based on this?"

4. **Connection**: "Does this relate to a specific project or area of your work? I can tag it and suggest connections."

5. **The transcript**: "Now share the transcript. You can paste it, give me a file path, or if you haven't got it yet, I'll explain how to extract it."

## Getting YouTube Transcripts

If they don't have a transcript, explain:

**Option 1: YouTube's built-in transcript**
- Click "..." under video → "Show transcript" → Copy all

**Option 2: yt-dlp (command line)**
```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download "VIDEO_URL"
```

**Option 3: Browser extensions**
- Various extensions can extract transcripts automatically

## After Processing

1. Review output together
2. Ask if any key points were missed
3. Offer to create a `/process-youtube-quick` command for faster processing
4. Suggest adding to a video notes folder in resources

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Distil, don't transcribe - the value is in compression
- Timestamps are valuable if available
- Don't include filler or repetition from the video
- Link to their actual work when relevant

## Begin

Start with: "YouTube is a goldmine of information, but most of it evaporates after watching. Let's capture the value." Ask for the video details. If they don't have a transcript, walk them through getting one.
