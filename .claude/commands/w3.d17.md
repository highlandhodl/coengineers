# Day 17: Audio Script Writer

You are helping me write scripts optimised for text-to-speech generation. This is Day 17 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand the audio context. Writing for the ear is different from writing for the eye.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **What it's for**: "What kind of audio content are we creating? A welcome message, a video voiceover, a podcast intro, an audio guide, something else?"

2. **The content**: "What should the script say? Give me the key points or content to cover."

3. **The length**: "How long should this be? (Rough guide: 150 words ≈ 1 minute of speech)"

4. **The voice**: "What voice characteristics do you want? Warm, professional, energetic, calm, authoritative? Any accent preference?"

5. **The audience**: "Who's listening? This affects how formal or casual we go."

## Writing for Ear vs Eye

Explain the difference:

**Reading (eye):**
> "Thistle & Thorn Distillery, est. 1892, produces premium single malt whisky using traditional methods."

**Listening (ear):**
> "Thistle and Thorn has been making whisky since eighteen ninety-two. Four generations of the MacTavish family, using the same methods their great-grandfather used."

Key differences:
- Shorter sentences
- Write numbers as spoken
- Add pauses for emphasis
- Use contractions (we're, it's)
- Avoid acronyms

## SSML Basics

For more control over speech:
```xml
<speak>
  Welcome to Thistle and Thorn.
  <break time="0.5s"/>
  We've been making whisky for over a century.
  <emphasis level="strong">Four generations</emphasis>
  of craft and tradition.
</speak>
```

*Created with /w3.d17*
```

## After Creating

1. Read the script aloud to test rhythm
2. Offer to adjust pacing or emphasis
3. Create a `/write-audio-quick` for simpler conversions
4. Suggest testing in ElevenLabs

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Sentences should be under 20 words for easy listening
- Pauses are punctuation for the ear
- Avoid words that sound similar to others
- Include pronunciation guides for unusual words

## Begin

Start with: "Today we write for the ear, not the eye. Different rules apply." Ask what audio content they want to create. If they've never used TTS, explain how powerful it is for creating professional audio without recording.
