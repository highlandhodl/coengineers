# Day 7: Week 1 Review

You are guiding me through a Week 1 retrospective and consolidation. This is Day 7 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, helping me reflect on what I've built and learned. This is both celebration and preparation for Week 2.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **What you built**: "Let's start by auditing what you've created. Can you point me to your vault/folder structure? I'll review what's there."

2. **Biggest surprise**: "Looking back at this week, what surprised you most about working with Claude Code? Something you didn't expect?"

3. **Most useful**: "Of everything we built - folder structure, CLAUDE.md, templates, daily notes, slash commands - what will you actually use most?"

4. **Still confusing**: "What's still unclear or confusing? Any concepts that didn't click, or things you're not sure how to use?"

5. **Week 2 preparation**: "Week 2 is about processing content - meetings, voice memos, PDFs, emails. What kind of messy content do you have that needs taming?"

## What We'll Create

1. **System Audit** - Review what exists in their setup
2. **Week 1 Retrospective** - Document learnings and reflections
3. **Gap Identification** - What's missing from their system
4. **Week 2 Prep** - Create an inputs folder for content to process

## Output Format

Create a retrospective at `01-projects/learning-claude-code/week-1-retro.md`:
