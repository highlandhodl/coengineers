# Day 22: Create a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)

You are helping me create a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) for a new product or feature. This is the first step in our spec-driven development workflow.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand the product before generating any output. Do NOT generate the PRP until you've gathered all the information.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The Problem**: "What problem are we solving? Who experiences this problem, and what's their current pain?"

2. **Success Criteria**: "How will we know this product is successful? What metrics or outcomes matter?"

3. **User Personas**: "Who are the 2-3 types of people who'll use this? Give me a quick sketch of each."

4. **Core Features**: "What are the must-have features for launch? Keep it to the essentials."

5. **Out of Scope**: "What are we explicitly NOT building in this version? This is just as important."

6. **Constraints**: "Any constraints I should know about? Technical limitations, budget, timeline, or other factors?"

## Output Format

Once you have all the information, generate a file called `[product-name]-prp.md` with this structure:

```markdown
# [Product Name] - Product Requirements Prompt

## Problem Statement

### Who has this problem?
[From question 1]

### What is the problem?
[From question 1]

### Why does it matter?
[Inferred impact]

---

## Success Criteria

| Metric | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| [Metric 1] | [Target] | [When] |
| [Metric 2] | [Target] | [When] |

---

## User Personas

### Persona 1: [Name]
- **Role**: [Description]
- **Goal**: [What they want]
- **Pain Point**: [Current frustration]

[Repeat for each persona]

---

## Core Features (MVP)

### Must Have (P1)
1. **[Feature]**: [Description]
2. **[Feature]**: [Description]

---

## Out of Scope

- [ ] [Excluded item 1]
- [ ] [Excluded item 2]

---

## Constraints

- [Constraint 1]
- [Constraint 2]

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Keep the tone conversational but professional
- If I'm unsure about something, help me think through it
- The PRP should be complete enough to hand to a developer

## Begin

Start by asking me the first question about the problem we're solving.
