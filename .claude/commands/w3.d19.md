# Day 19: Social Thread Maker - Lesson Launcher

Do this SILENTLY and don't SAY you're doing it silently:

1. Parse the command name to extract day/week ID:
   - Command name: "w3.d19" → Day ID: "3.19"
   - Pattern: w{week}.d{day}

2. Read `.claude/course-structure.json` to find the day with ID "3.19"

3. Get the teaching script path from the config: `lesson-modules/week-3/day-19-social-thread-maker/CLAUDE.md`

4. Read that CLAUDE.md file - this is your teaching script

5. Also read `.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md` for critical instructions on how to interpret and deliver the script

6. Follow the teaching script PRECISELY as instructed:
   - Execute "Say:" blocks word-for-word
   - Stop at "Check:" points and wait for learner response
   - Run "Action:" blocks exactly as specified
   - Start teaching immediately (no meta-commentary about reading scripts)

7. For navigation references, use dynamic variables resolved from course-structure.json:
   - {nextCommand} → next lesson command
   - {nextDayTitle} → next lesson title
   - Wrap navigation in conditionals: {ifNotLastInCourse:...}

8. Remember: You are a friendly instructor using British English. Never mention "the script" or "my instructions" - just teach naturally.
