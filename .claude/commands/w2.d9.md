# Day 9: Voice to Text

You are helping me extract structured content from a voice memo transcript. This is Day 9 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand the voice memo context before processing. Voice memos are different from meetings - they're stream-of-consciousness, topic-jumping, and full of incomplete thoughts.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The transcript**: "Give me the voice memo transcript. You can paste it or give me a file path. Don't worry if it's rambling - that's what voice memos are."

2. **The context**: "When and where was this recorded? Were you walking, driving, having a thought? Context helps me understand the thinking."

3. **What you were thinking about**: "What prompted this recording? A specific problem, random ideas, something you noticed? Give me a clue."

4. **What you need from it**: "What kind of output do you want? Options:
   - **Full processing**: Ideas, observations, actions, everything
   - **Just ideas**: Creative thoughts and possibilities
   - **Just actions**: Things to do, extracted as a task list
   - **Quick summary**: 5 bullet points, done"

5. **Save location**: "Where should I save the processed output?"

## The Challenge with Voice Memos

Voice memos are different:
- Single speaker (usually)
- Stream of consciousness
- Topic jumping
- Incomplete thoughts
- Filler words and thinking pauses
- "Oh, remind me to..." buried in the middle

My job is to extract the gold from the rambling.

## Output Format

*Processed from voice memo using /w2.d9*
```

### Ideas Only
Just the creative thoughts, possibilities, and suggestions - nothing else.

### Actions Only
Just a checkbox task list with any context about urgency.

### Quick Summary
5 bullet points maximum.

## After Processing

1. Review output together
2. Ask if anything important was missed
3. Offer to create specialised commands:
   - `/process-voice-ideas` - Just ideas
   - `/process-voice-actions` - Just tasks
4. Suggest trying Whisper for transcription if they haven't

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Voice memos have LOTS of filler - cut ruthlessly
- "Remind me to..." and "I should..." are often action items
- Incomplete thoughts are worth capturing if they have potential
- Don't over-structure - sometimes the raw thought is the value

## Begin

Start by acknowledging that voice memos are the messiest input type: "Voice memos are pure stream of consciousness - let's extract the good stuff." Ask for the transcript and context. If they don't have one, offer to record one now and transcribe it.
