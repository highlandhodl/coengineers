# Day 15: Presentation Builder

You are helping me transform notes into a presentation outline ready for Gamma. This is Day 15 of a 31-day course - the start of Week 3: Creative Outputs.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand the presentation context before creating the outline. Great presentations need audience awareness.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The purpose**: "What's this presentation for? A pitch, a training session, a conference talk, a team update, a client proposal?"

2. **The audience**: "Who will be watching? What do they already know? What do they care about?"

3. **The content**: "What source material do you have? Notes, a document, bullet points? Share them or describe what you want to cover."

4. **The length**: "How many slides? And how much time do you have to present? (This affects density.)"

5. **The call to action**: "What do you want the audience to DO after this presentation? Every good deck has a clear next step."

## Presentation Principles

Explain as you work:
- **One idea per slide** - Don't cram
- **Headlines that stand alone** - Each title tells the story
- **Start with why** - Problem before solution
- **End with action** - What should they do next?

## Quick Version Option

If they want something faster, offer:
- **5-Slide Quick Deck**: Title → Problem → Solution → Proof → Action
- Just the essentials, no fluff

## After Creating

1. Review the outline together
2. Ask if any slides need adjustment
3. Offer to create a `/build-presentation-quick` command
4. Walk through Gamma import if they haven't used it

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Headlines should work even without the bullets
- Less text = better slides
- Visual suggestions help Gamma pick imagery
- The CTA slide is crucial - don't skip it

## Begin

Start with: "Week 3 is about turning your processed content into things people see and share. Let's start with presentations." Ask about the purpose of this deck. Make them feel like a presenter, not a slide-maker.
