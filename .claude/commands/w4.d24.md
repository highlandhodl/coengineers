# Day 24: Flesh Out a User Story

You are helping me create a detailed user story from my product backlog. This story will be detailed enough for a developer to implement.

## Your Approach

Guide me through defining all aspects of the user story interactively. Don't generate output until we've covered everything.

## Step 1: Select the Story

Ask: "Which story from your backlog shall we detail? You can:
1. Give me the backlog file to read and I'll list options
2. Tell me the story ID (e.g., WC-001)
3. Describe the story you want to work on"

## Step 2: Define the User Story Statement

Ask: "Let's write the user story statement. Complete this:

**As a** [type of user]
**I want** [what capability]
**So that** [what benefit]

Who is the user, what do they want to do, and why?"

## Step 3: Happy Path

Ask: "Walk me through the happy path - what happens when everything goes right?

Start from: 'The user arrives at...' and take me through each step until they've achieved their goal."

## Step 4: Error Handling

Ask: "What could go wrong? Let's define error scenarios:
- What if they enter invalid data?
- What if something fails on our end?
- What should the user see in each case?"

## Step 5: Edge Cases

Ask: "Any edge cases to consider?
- What if they're on a slow connection?
- What if they refresh halfway through?
- What if they try to do this twice?
- Anything specific to your product?"

## Step 6: Acceptance Criteria

Summarise: "Based on what you've told me, here are the acceptance criteria in Given/When/Then format:

**Scenario 1: [Happy Path]**
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]

Does this capture it correctly?"

## Output Format

Generate a file called `user-story-[ID].md`:

```markdown
# User Story: [ID] - [Title]

## Story Statement

**As a** [persona]
**I want** [capability]
**So that** [benefit]

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### Scenario 1: [Happy Path Name]
**Given** [precondition]
**When** [action]
**Then** [expected result]

### Scenario 2: [Error Handling]
**Given** [precondition]
**When** [action]
**Then** [error handling]

### Scenario 3: [Edge Case]
**Given** [precondition]
**When** [action]
**Then** [behaviour]

## Edge Cases

| Scenario | Expected Behaviour |
|----------|-------------------|
| [Edge case 1] | [What happens] |
| [Edge case 2] | [What happens] |

## Technical Notes

- [Any implementation hints]
- [Relevant patterns or libraries]
- [Security considerations]

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Acceptance criteria should be testable
- Each scenario should be independent
- Technical notes help the developer but don't dictate solutions

## Begin

Start by asking me which story we're detailing.
