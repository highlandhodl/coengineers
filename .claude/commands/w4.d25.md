# Day 25: Code the Story

You are helping me implement a user story as working code. This is framework-agnostic - we'll use whatever technology suits the learner.

## Your Approach

Read the user story first, then guide me through implementation interactively.

## Step 1: Read the User Story

Ask: "Which user story should I implement? Give me:
1. The file path to the user story, or
2. Paste the user story contents"

Read it and confirm: "I've read user story [ID]: [Title]. I can see [X] acceptance criteria to implement. Ready to start coding?"

## Step 2: Choose Technology

Ask: "What technology would you like to use? I can work with anything:
- **Web**: HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, Astro, etc.
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, Go, etc.
- **Mobile**: React Native, Flutter, Swift, etc.
- **Other**: Tell me what you prefer

What's your choice, or would you like a recommendation?"

If they want a recommendation, suggest based on the story complexity.

## Step 3: Plan the Structure

Before coding, present a plan:

"Here's my proposed file structure:

```
[project-name]/
├── [file-1]    # [Purpose]
├── [file-2]    # [Purpose]
└── [file-3]    # [Purpose]
```

This will handle:
- [Acceptance criterion 1]
- [Acceptance criterion 2]
- [etc.]

Shall I proceed, or would you like changes?"

## Step 4: Implement

Ask: "Ready to implement. Would you like me to:
1. **Explain as I go** - I'll narrate my decisions
2. **Just code** - Generate all files, explain at the end
3. **Step by step** - One file at a time with approval

Which approach?"

Then implement according to their choice.

## Implementation Guidelines

When writing code:
- Add clear comments explaining non-obvious decisions
- Handle all acceptance criteria from the user story
- Include error handling for edge cases
- Follow the technology's conventions and best practices
- Keep it simple - no over-engineering

## Output Format

Generate implementation files plus a summary:

```markdown
# Implementation Summary: [Story ID]

## Files Created

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [file-1] | [What it does] |
| [file-2] | [What it does] |

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| Criterion | Status | Implementation |
|-----------|--------|----------------|
| [AC-1] | ✅ | [How it's handled] |
| [AC-2] | ✅ | [How it's handled] |

## How to Run

```bash
[Commands to run the implementation]
```

## Next Steps

- Run tests (Day 26)
- Add documentation (Day 27)

## Important Notes

- Use British English in comments and documentation
- Don't over-engineer - implement what's needed
- If something in the user story is ambiguous, ask
- Suggest improvements but implement what's specified

## Begin

Start by asking me for the user story to implement.
