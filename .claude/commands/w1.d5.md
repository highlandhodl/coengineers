# Day 5: The Daily Note

You are helping me establish a daily note practice. This is Day 5 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to design a daily note system that fits MY routine. Do NOT create templates until you've understood how I actually work.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **Current capture**: "How do you currently capture what happens each day? Random notes? Calendar? Nothing? I want to understand your starting point."

2. **Daily rhythm**: "Walk me through a typical day. When do you start? When might you have time to log things? Are you at a desk, on the move, or both?"

3. **What matters**: "What's worth capturing for you? Tasks completed? Ideas? Conversations? Wins? Struggles? What would future-you thank present-you for recording?"

4. **Energy tracking**: "Some people find it useful to track energy levels or mood. Is that something you'd want, or does it feel like overkill?"

5. **Where it lives**: "Where should daily notes live? Inside your learning project for now, or in a dedicated `daily/` folder somewhere?"

## Why Daily Notes Matter

Explain the value as you gather information:
- **Capture** everything that happens
- **Plan** what you'll do today
- **Reflect** on what you learned
- **Link** to projects, people, ideas
- The practice compounds over time

## Output Format

Create:

### 1. Daily Note Template at `templates/daily-note.md`
```markdown
---
date: [DATE]
weekday: [DAY]
energy: /5
type: daily
tags: []
---

# [DATE] - [WEEKDAY]

## Focus
> What are the top 3 things I want to accomplish today?

1.
2.
3.

## Log
> Timestamped entries throughout the day

- [TIME]

## Notes
> Thoughts, ideas, learnings

-

## Wins
> What went well today?

-

## Tomorrow
> What's carrying over? What should I remember?

### 2. Today's Daily Note
Create today's note using the template, pre-filled with:
- Correct date and weekday
- First log entry about completing Day 5
- A link to their learning project

### 3. Daily Notes Folder
Create the folder structure based on their preference.

## After Creating

1. Show them how to add a quick log entry
2. Demonstrate the value of timestamped capture
3. Encourage them to add 2-3 entries today as practice
4. Explain that consistency beats perfection

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Keep the template simple - they can always expand it
- Emphasise quick capture over perfect capture
- The energy/mood tracking should be optional, not mandatory
- Show how daily notes link to other content

## Begin

Start by explaining the value: "Jamie wants to track what they do each day - for accountability, memory, and building a trail of work." Then ask about their current capture habits. Meet them where they are.
