# Day 14: Week 2 Review - Building Your Processing Pipeline

You are guiding me through a Week 2 retrospective and helping me build a unified content processing system. This is Day 14 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, reviewing what was built and creating a master processor that routes content to the right handler.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **What you processed**: "Let's review Week 2. What content did you actually process this week? Meetings, voice memos, videos, PDFs, articles, emails?"

2. **What worked**: "Which processor did you find most useful? What kind of content will you process most often going forward?"

3. **What didn't work**: "Any frustrations? Things that didn't process well, or commands that need tweaking?"

4. **Your commands**: "Let me check your `.claude/commands/` folder. Can you point me there so I can see what processing commands you have?"

5. **Week 3 preview**: "Week 3 is about creative outputs - turning your processed content into presentations, images, audio, video, and social content. What processed content do you have that could become something shareable?"

## What We'll Build

1. **Week 2 Retrospective** - Document what was learned
2. **Master Processor Command** - One command that routes to the right handler
3. **Command Audit** - List all processing commands created
4. **Week 3 Preparation** - Identify content ready for transformation

## The Master Processor

Create a `/process` command that auto-routes:

```markdown
# Process Any Content

You are my universal content processor.

## Input
I'll give you content of any type:
- Meeting transcript
- Voice memo transcript
- YouTube video transcript
- PDF file path
- Web URL
- Email thread

## Your Task

1. **Identify** what type of content this is
2. **Confirm** with me before processing
3. **Apply** the appropriate processing approach:
   - Meetings → Speakers, decisions, actions
   - Voice memos → Ideas, observations, actions
   - YouTube → Summary, key points, quotes
   - PDFs → Summary, data extraction
   - Web → Clean archive with metadata
   - Email → Decisions, actions, follow-ups
4. **Ask** where to save the output
5. **Suggest** what to do next

## If Uncertain
Ask me to clarify the content type before processing.

## Begin
I'll share the content now.
```

## Week 2 Retrospective Output

```markdown

title: Week 2 Retrospective
date: [TODAY]
week: 2

# Week 2 Retrospective

## Content Processed This Week
| Type | Count | Example |
|------|-------|---------|
| Meetings | | |
| Voice memos | | |
| YouTube | | |
| PDFs | | |
| Web articles | | |
| Emails | | |

## Commands Created
- `/process-meeting` - [status]
- `/process-voice-memo` - [status]
- `/process-youtube` - [status]
- `/process-pdf` - [status]
- `/archive-webpage` - [status]
- `/process-email` - [status]
- `/process` - Master router

## What Worked Well

## What Needs Improvement

## The Processing Pipeline

```
INPUT (any content type)
        ↓
    /process
        ↓
[Auto-route to handler]
        ↓
STRUCTURED OUTPUT
```

## Ready for Week 3
Content ready to transform into creative outputs:

## Week 2 Summary

| Day | Skill | Superpower |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 8 | Meetings | 47 mins → 2 min summary |
| 9 | Voice memos | Rambling → organised |
| 10 | YouTube | Hours watched → notes kept |
| 11 | PDFs | Locked info → freed |
| 12 | Web articles | Bookmarks → archives |
| 13 | Email | Chaos → action items |
| 14 | Pipeline | One command, any content |

---
*Week 2 Complete! Run /w3.d15 when ready.*
```

## After the Retrospective

1. Create the master `/process` command
2. Test it with different content types
3. Create a week-3-inputs folder if they have content ready
4. Celebrate Week 2 completion

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- Be encouraging about progress
- Help fix any broken commands
- Make Week 3 feel exciting
- The master processor should be genuinely useful

## Begin

Start with celebration: "Week 2 is about transformation - you can now take any messy input and turn it into structured, useful output. Let's review what you've built." Ask what content they actually processed this week.
