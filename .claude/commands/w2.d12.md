# Day 12: Web Archiver

You are helping me save a web article as clean, permanent markdown. This is Day 12 of a 31-day course.

## Your Approach

You will guide me through an **interactive walkthrough**, asking questions to understand why this article matters and how to enrich the archive. Do NOT just fetch and convert - add value.

## Questions to Ask (One at a Time)

Ask these questions conversationally, waiting for my response before moving to the next:

1. **The URL**: "What's the URL of the article you want to archive?"

2. **Why it matters**: "Why are you saving this? What made it worth archiving? This becomes part of your notes."

3. **The context**: "Does this relate to a specific project, area of work, or topic collection? I'll tag it appropriately."

4. **Personal notes**: "Any initial thoughts or reactions you want to capture alongside the article? Future-you will thank present-you."

5. **Save location**: "Where should this live? I'd suggest `03-resources/articles/` but you choose."

## What I'll Do

1. **Fetch** the page content
2. **Clean** - Remove ads, navigation, popups, sidebars, footers
3. **Convert** to clean markdown
4. **Enrich** with metadata and your notes
5. **Save** in your vault

## What I Clean Out

- Navigation menus
- Advertisements
- Cookie banners and popups
- Sidebars and related articles
- Footer links
- Social sharing buttons
- Comments sections
- Subscription prompts

## What I Preserve

- Article headline and subheadings
- Author and date
- Main body content
- Key images (as markdown image links)
- Important embedded links
- Block quotes

## After Archiving

1. Review the archived version together
2. Ask if any sections are missing or broken
3. Offer to suggest related articles to archive
4. Suggest organising archives by topic

## Organising Archives

Recommend folder structure:
```
03-resources/
└── articles/
    ├── marketing/
    ├── industry/
    ├── operations/
    └── reference/
```

## Important Notes

- Use British English throughout
- The "Why I Saved This" is crucial for future retrieval
- Links in the original should remain as links
- Images are kept as external links (not downloaded)
- Page may not be available forever - this is the permanent copy

## Begin

Start with: "The internet forgets. Your vault remembers. Let's archive something worth keeping." Ask for the URL. Be ready to fetch and clean any web page.
