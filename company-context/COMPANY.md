## Mission & Vision

**Mission**: Empower professionals to 10x their productivity by making Claude Code accessible, learnable, and indispensable.

**Vision**: A world where every knowledge worker has an AI pair programmer that understands their work, learns their patterns, and amplifies their capabilities.

**Values**:

1. **Teaching over Telling** - We don't just build tools, we teach people how to use them brilliantly.
2. **Real Work, Real Problems** - We solve actual pain points, not theoretical ones.
3. **Accessible Power** - Advanced capabilities wrapped in intuitive experiences.
4. **Ship and Iterate** - Perfect is the enemy of useful. Ship, learn, improve.
5. **Open and Honest** - Transparent about what works, what doesn't, and what we're learning.

## The Origin Story

CoEngine started when founders Sarah Chen (ex-Figma PM) and James O'Brien (ex-GitHub engineer) kept seeing the same pattern: people were excited about Claude Code but struggled to move beyond basic prompts.

"Everyone would start with 'write me a function to...' but then hit a wall when they wanted to do something more sophisticated," says Sarah. "We realised there was a massive gap between the tutorial and the truly powerful workflows."

They spent three months interviewing product managers, designers, marketers, and engineers about their Claude Code usage. The insight: **people needed a learning curve, not just a tool.**

In January 2024, they launched CoEngineers—a 31-day course that taught Claude Code through real, hands-on projects. It resonated immediately. Within three months, 5,000 professionals had completed the course.

The seed round followed in June 2024. Now CoEngine is building on that success with plugins, templates, and workflows that extend Claude Code for professional use cases.

**Why**: Revenue correlates strongly with completion. Graduates become advocates and premium subscribers.

**Initiatives**:

- Add more interactive checkpoints and guided teaching scripts
- Create realistic supporting materials for every lesson
- Build company context to create cohesive narrative
- Implement config-driven navigation for better flow

**Owner**: You (Alex Morrison)

### 2. Launch Command Marketplace

**Initiatives**:

- Build team management and billing
- Create enterprise onboarding experience
- Develop team analytics dashboard

**Owner**: Maya Patel, with Rachel Foster (Operations)

## Competitive Positioning

**We're not competing with**:

- Claude/Anthropic (we make their product more useful)
- Cursor, GitHub Copilot (different use cases - we're about workflows, not code completion)
- Traditional online courses (we're teaching through doing, not watching videos)

**We're competing with**:

- DIY/self-taught approaches (YouTube tutorials, blog posts)
- Prompt engineering courses that are too theoretical
- General AI productivity tools that try to do everything

**Our differentiator**: We're the only structured learning experience that teaches Claude Code specifically, through hands-on projects, with a clear methodology.

---

## What's Next for CoEngine

**Short-term (Next 3 months)**:

- Immersive learning system with teaching scripts (current focus)
- Command marketplace beta launch
- First 10 enterprise customers

**Medium-term (6-12 months)**:

- Team collaboration features
- Advanced workflows and automation
- Integration with popular PM tools (Notion, Linear, Jira)

**Long-term (12+ months)**:

- AI coach that personalises the learning experience
- Community-driven curriculum with specialised tracks
- Certification programme and partner network

---

## Company Context for Exercises

Throughout this course, you'll work on projects for CoEngine. This gives you consistent context, familiar users (see PERSONAS.md), and realistic product constraints.

Some exercises will ask you to:

- Write PRDs for new CoEngine features
- Analyse user research from CoEngine customers
- Design workflows for CoEngine product managers
- Build prototypes of CoEngine functionality

Remember: CoEngine is fictional, but the problems are real. We've modelled the company on actual challenges faced by developer tool startups.
