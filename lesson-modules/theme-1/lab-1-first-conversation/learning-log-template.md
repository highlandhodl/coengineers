## Tips for Keeping Your Learning Log

1. **Be specific about prompts** - Copy the exact wording you used, not a paraphrase
2. **Note the context** - What were you trying to achieve? What files were involved?
3. **Record surprises** - Did Claude do something unexpected? That's valuable learning
4. **Track patterns** - After a few entries, look for what makes your prompts more effective
5. **Review weekly** - Spend 10 minutes each Friday looking back at your entries

## Example Entry

### Date: 10 December 2024

### Prompt I Used

```
Create a meeting notes file in my Projects folder for today's standup with the dev team.
```

### Response Summary

Claude Code created a well-structured meeting notes file with sections for attendees, agenda, discussion, decisions, and action items.

### What I Learned

- I don't need to specify every detail - Claude can infer common patterns
- Meeting notes follow a standard structure I can rely on
- Specifying the folder (Projects/) helps Claude know where to put the file

### Things That Worked Well

- Being specific about the meeting type (standup) gave Claude context
- Mentioning the team (dev team) was useful for the attendees section

### Things That Didn't Work As Expected

- I forgot to mention the date, so Claude used today's date automatically
- Could have been more specific about the project name

### Questions or Confusion

- Should I create a template for recurring meetings?
- How do I organise multiple meeting notes in the same project?

### What I'd Do Differently Next Time

Next time I'll mention the specific project: "Create a meeting notes file in Projects/Website-Launch/ for today's standup with the dev team."
