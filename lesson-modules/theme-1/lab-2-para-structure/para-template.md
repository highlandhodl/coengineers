# PARA Structure Template

This document provides a template for setting up the PARA method in your Obsidian vault.

## What is PARA?

PARA is a productivity system created by Tiago Forte that organises information into four categories:

- **Projects** - Short-term efforts with specific goals and deadlines
- **Areas** - Ongoing responsibilities that need maintenance
- **Resources** - Topics of interest or reference materials
- **Archives** - Inactive items from the other three categories

## Folder Structure

```

├── Projects/
│   ├── [Active-Project-1]/
│   ├── [Active-Project-2]/
│   └── [Active-Project-3]/
├── Areas/
│   ├── [Ongoing-Area-1]/
│   ├── [Ongoing-Area-2]/
│   └── [Ongoing-Area-3]/

│   ├── [Topic-2]/
│   └── [Topic-3]/
└── Archives/
    ├── Projects/
    ├── Areas/
    └── Resources/
```

## Example Projects

Projects are time-bound efforts with clear outcomes:

- Launch-Website
- Q4-Report
- Learn-Python
- Plan-Holiday
- Organise-Conference

## Example Areas

Areas are ongoing responsibilities without end dates:

- Health-Fitness
- Finance-Budgeting
- Professional-Development
- Home-Maintenance
- Team-Management
- Personal-Relationships

## Example Resources

Resources are reference materials organised by topic:

- Python-Programming
- Marketing-Strategies
- Product-Management
- Photography-Tips
- Cooking-Recipes
- Book-Summaries

## Decision Tree: Where Does This Note Go?

1. **Is it related to a project with a deadline?** → Projects/
2. **Is it part of an ongoing responsibility?** → Areas/
3. **Is it reference material on a topic?** → Resources/
4. **Is it completed or no longer active?** → Archives/

## Moving to Archives

When a project completes:

```
Projects/Launch-Website/ → Archives/Projects/Launch-Website/
```

When you're no longer responsible for an area:

```
Areas/Team-Management/ → Archives/Areas/Team-Management/
```

When a resource topic is no longer relevant:

```
Resources/Photography-Tips/ → Archives/Resources/Photography-Tips/
```

## Best Practices

1. **Keep project names specific** - "Launch-Website" beats "Project-1"
2. **Limit active projects** - 5-10 active projects is realistic for most people
3. **Review weekly** - Every Friday, check what can move to Archives
4. **Don't over-nest** - One level of subfolders is usually enough
5. **Start minimal** - Create folders as you need them, not all at once

## Common Questions

**Q: What if something fits in multiple categories?**

A: Choose based on how you'll use it most. If you're actively working on it with a deadline, it's a Project. If it's ongoing maintenance, it's an Area.

**Q: Can I have an Inbox folder?**

A: Yes! Create an Inbox/ outside PARA for temporary notes. Process it weekly and file things into PARA.

**Q: Should I use PARA for everything?**

A: PARA works best for knowledge work and personal productivity. You don't need to force everything into it.
