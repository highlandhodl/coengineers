## How to Use These Templates

1. **Copy the template** - Select the entire template and copy it
2. **Create a new note** - Make a new file with a descriptive name
3. **Paste and fill in** - Replace the [bracketed] sections with your actual content
4. **Delete unused sections** - Remove any sections that don't apply to your use case
5. **Save and use** - Your template folder becomes a productivity tool

## Customisation Tips

- **Add or remove sections** - These are starting points, not rules
- **Create variations** - Meeting-Notes-Brief vs Meeting-Notes-Detailed
- **Keep it simple** - Only include sections you actually use
- **Iterate** - Your templates will improve as you use them
