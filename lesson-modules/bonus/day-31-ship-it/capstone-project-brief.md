# Capstone Project: Ship Your Own Feature

## Welcome to Your Final Challenge

You've spent 30 days learning Claude Code workflows, from basic templating to full spec-driven development. Now it's time to bring everything together and ship something real.

This capstone is deliberately open-ended. You'll apply everything you've learned—BMAD method, PRP framework, product thinking, and Claude Code mastery—to build and ship a feature that matters to you.

---

## The Challenge

**Build and ship a complete feature using the full Week 4 workflow:**

1. Define it (PRP)
2. Plan it (Product Backlog)
3. Spec it (User Stories)
4. Build it (Implementation)
5. Test it (Verification)
6. Document it (README + Guide)
7. Ship it (Deploy + Retrospective)

---

## Project Requirements

### Must Include

- [ ] Complete PRP using the advanced template from Day 30
- [ ] Product backlog with at least 5 prioritised user stories
- [ ] 1-3 fully implemented user stories
- [ ] Test coverage for core functionality
- [ ] Professional documentation (README + setup guide)
- [ ] Deployed/shipped in some form (even if just GitHub)
- [ ] Retrospective document analysing what worked and what didn't

### Quality Bar

- [ ] Code quality matches professional standards
- [ ] Documentation is clear enough for someone else to use/maintain
- [ ] Feature solves a real problem (not a toy project)
- [ ] You'd be comfortable showing this to a potential employer

---

## Project Ideas (Choose Your Own Adventure)

### Idea 1: CoEngine Feature

Build a feature for the fictional CoEngine company you've been working with all month.

**Example features:**

- Command template marketplace (browse, install, share templates)
- Usage analytics dashboard (track which commands you use most)
- Team collaboration tools (share commands with teammates)
- AI prompt library (save and version control your best prompts)
- Workflow automation (chain commands together)

**Why this is good**: You already understand the company, product, and users. You have existing context to build on.

### Idea 2: Personal Productivity Tool

Build something that solves a problem in your own workflow.

**Example features:**

- Meeting notes processor (transcripts → action items → calendar blocks)
- Email triage system (categorise, prioritise, draft responses)
- Learning log aggregator (combine notes from multiple sources)
- Project status compiler (generate updates from git commits + notes)
- Knowledge base builder (convert messy notes into searchable wiki)

**Why this is good**: You understand the problem intimately. You'll use what you build.

### Idea 3: Content Creation Tool

Build something that helps create or transform content.

**Example features:**

- Blog post generator (research → outline → draft → SEO optimisation)
- Social media scheduler (one post → multi-platform variations)
- Presentation builder (notes → slides → speaker notes)
- Video script writer (brief → script → B-roll suggestions → captions)
- Newsletter compiler (curated links → formatted email → send)

**Why this is good**: Content tools have clear inputs and outputs. Easy to demo and showcase.

### Idea 4: Developer Tool

Build something technical that helps developers work better.

**Example features:**

- Code review summariser (git diff → summary → suggestions)
- Documentation generator (code → API docs → examples)
- Test case generator (requirements → test scenarios → test code)
- PR description writer (commits → detailed PR with context)
- Changelog compiler (commits → formatted, grouped changelog)

**Why this is good**: Technical projects demonstrate engineering skill. Great for developer portfolios.

### Idea 5: Learning/Education Tool

Build something that helps people learn or teach.

**Example features:**

- Study guide generator (textbook chapter → key concepts → quiz questions)
- Tutorial builder (topic → step-by-step guide → code examples)
- Concept explainer (complex topic → simplified explanation → analogies)
- Practice problem generator (topic → problems → solutions → hints)
- Learning path creator (goal → curriculum → resources → milestones)

**Why this is good**: Meta—using what you learned to help others learn. Clear value proposition.

## Scope Guidance

### This is Too Small

- Single slash command with no supporting infrastructure
- Simple text transformation with no persistence
- Feature that takes <2 hours to build
- Tutorial walkthrough with no original work

### This is Just Right

- Feature with 3-5 interconnected user stories
- Requires data persistence or external integrations
- Takes 1-3 days of focused work to build
- Has deployment/sharing considerations
- Solves a real problem, not a made-up one

### This is Too Big

- Multi-week project requiring team collaboration
- Complex infrastructure with multiple services
- Feature requiring skills you don't have yet
- Anything with "and also it does..." repeated more than twice

**Rule of thumb**: If you can't ship something demonstrable in 3 days of focused work, reduce scope.

## The Week 4 Workflow (Refresher)

### Day 1: The Product Idea (PRP)

Use the advanced PRP template from Day 30. Be thorough—this is your north star.

**Time allocation**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverable**: Completed advanced PRP document

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Review this PRP for completeness and coherence. What am I missing? What assumptions should I validate?"

### Day 2: The Product Backlog

Break your PRP into prioritised user stories. Use Moscow method (Must/Should/Could/Won't).

**Time allocation**: 1-2 hours

**Deliverable**: Backlog with 5-10 user stories, clearly prioritised

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Based on this PRP, generate a prioritised product backlog using the Moscow method."

### Day 3: The User Story

Pick your top 1-3 user stories and spec them in detail. Acceptance criteria, edge cases, technical approach.

**Time allocation**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverable**: Detailed specs for 1-3 user stories

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Take this user story and break it down into technical tasks with clear acceptance criteria."

### Day 4-5: Code the Story

Implement your prioritised user stories. Use Claude Code for scaffolding, implementation, and debugging.

**Time allocation**: 6-12 hours (across 2 days)

**Deliverable**: Working implementation of 1-3 user stories

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Based on this user story spec, generate the implementation with file structure, code, and tests."

### Day 6: Test the Story

Write tests, do manual QA, get feedback from a friend or colleague.

**Time allocation**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverable**: Test coverage and QA checklist completion

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Generate test cases for this feature covering happy paths, edge cases, and error scenarios."

### Day 7: Document the Story

Write README, setup instructions, usage guide, and API docs if applicable.

**Time allocation**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverable**: Complete documentation

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Based on this codebase, generate comprehensive documentation including README, setup guide, and usage examples."

### Day 8: Ship It!

Deploy, share, and write your retrospective.

**Time allocation**: 2-3 hours

**Deliverable**: Deployed feature + retrospective document

**Claude Code assist**:

> "Help me create a deployment checklist and guide me through shipping this feature."

## Tips for Success

### Start with Scope

The biggest mistake is choosing something too ambitious. Start small, ship it, then extend if you have time.

### Use the Templates

Don't skip the PRP and user story work. It feels like extra work, but it saves hours of confusion later.

### Timebox Ruthlessly

If Day 4 becomes Day 7, you've scope-creeped. Cut features, not quality.

### Get Feedback Early

Share your PRP with someone before you start coding. Share your WIP implementation mid-build.

### Document as You Go

Don't leave all documentation for Day 7. Write README sections as you complete features.

### Perfect is the Enemy of Shipped

V1 doesn't need to be perfect. Ship something that works, then iterate.

---

## Common Pitfalls

### The Boil-the-Ocean Trap

"I'll build a full project management platform with AI, real-time collaboration, and a mobile app."

**Fix**: Pick ONE core user story and build that brilliantly.

### The Toy Project Trap

"I'll build a todo app because it's easy."

**Fix**: Only build something if it solves a problem you actually have.

### The Tutorial Trap

"I'll follow a tutorial and call it my capstone."

**Fix**: Tutorials are fine for learning, but your capstone should be original work.

### The Perfectionism Trap

"I can't ship until the UI is pixel-perfect and there's 100% test coverage."

**Fix**: Set a quality bar that's "good enough to show someone" and ship when you hit it.

### The No-Feedback Trap

"I'll build in isolation and surprise everyone when I'm done."

**Fix**: Share your PRP, share WIP screenshots, get feedback early and often.

After you ship, write an honest retrospective. This is as important as the code.

## Example Capstones (For Inspiration)

### Example 1: Command Usage Tracker

**Problem**: "I can't remember which Claude Code commands I've created or which ones I use most."

**Solution**: CLI tool that tracks command usage, generates reports, and suggests optimisations.

**Stack**: Node.js CLI, SQLite for storage, simple terminal UI

**Scope**: 3 user stories (track usage, generate reports, suggest improvements)

**Shipping**: Published to npm, README with demo GIF

### Example 2: Meeting Notes Pipeline

**Problem**: "I have 20+ meeting notes files and can't find anything."

**Solution**: Web app that processes meeting notes, extracts action items, and creates searchable archive.

**Stack**: Next.js, Supabase, OpenAI API for extraction

**Scope**: 3 user stories (upload notes, extract actions, search archive)

**Shipping**: Deployed to Vercel, shareable demo link

### Example 3: PR Description Generator

**Problem**: "Writing good PR descriptions takes ages and I usually rush them."

**Solution**: CLI tool that reads git diff and generates detailed PR description with context.

**Stack**: Python CLI, Git integration, structured output

**Scope**: 2 user stories (generate description, copy to clipboard)

**Shipping**: GitHub repo with detailed README and demo video

## Final Thoughts

This capstone is your proof point. It demonstrates that you can:

1. **Think like a PM** - Define problems, scope solutions, prioritise ruthlessly
2. **Build like an engineer** - Write code, test it, ship it
3. **Work with AI** - Use Claude Code as a powerful collaborator, not a magic button
4. **Ship like a pro** - Complete projects, document them, share them

The course ends here, but your journey with Claude Code is just beginning.

**Now go build something brilliant.**

## Getting Help

Stuck? Here's how to unstuck yourself:

1. **Review the templates**: BMAD, PRP, User Story templates are designed to guide you through uncertainty
2. **Ask Claude**: Literally paste "I'm stuck on [X]" and ask for guidance
3. **Reduce scope**: If you're overwhelmed, you're trying to build too much
4. **Ship something small**: Better to ship a small, polished feature than nothing
5. **Remember Week 1**: You've learned an incredible amount. Trust yourself.

**Your next command**: `/bonus.d31` (but you already ran it to see this brief!)

**Your next action**: Choose your project, fill out the PRP, and start building.

Good luck. You've got this.
