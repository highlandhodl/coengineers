## Assumptions

1. All team members have basic computer skills
2. Claude Pro subscriptions will be in place before training
3. Team members are willing and motivated to learn new tools
4. Current workflows are as described (no major changes during project)
5. Emma Wilson is authorised to make decisions without board approval
6. Team can accommodate training schedule during busy period

---

## Risks and Concerns

### Identified Risks

1. **Adoption resistance** - Some team members may resist change
   - _Mitigation:_ Individual support sessions, show quick wins early

2. **Holiday timing** - Reduced capacity in late December
   - _Mitigation:_ Front-load discovery and development, training in January

3. **Technical issues** - Claude Pro setup or access problems
   - _Mitigation:_ IT involvement early, backup support plans

### Emma's Concerns

> "I'm worried about maintaining quality. Our clients pay premium prices and expect premium work. The AI needs to enhance, not replace, our writers' expertise."

> "Training is always hard to schedule. People are busy. We need flexible options."

> "I need to show ROI to the board. Clear metrics are important."
