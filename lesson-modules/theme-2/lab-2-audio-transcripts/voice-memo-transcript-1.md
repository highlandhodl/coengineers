Okay so um, I'm walking to the coffee shop and I just had this idea that I wanted to capture before I forget it.

So we've been talking about the mobile app right, and everyone's focused on like making the web interface work on mobile, but what if... what if we actually thought about what mobile does really well that desktop doesn't?

Like, okay, so when you're on mobile you have your camera obviously, and you have location, and you have... um... notifications are more immediate, and there's this whole thing about quick capture right? Like on mobile you want to just, boom, do something quick and get back to whatever you were doing.

So I'm thinking instead of just shrinking the desktop interface, what if we built like a quick capture mode? Where you can take a photo of like a business card and it automatically creates a customer record? Or you're at a client meeting and you can... hang on... sorry...

[background noise - car passing]

...anyway you could hit like a quick note button and it's just voice to text, doesn't even show you a form, just records "met with sarah, discussed renewal, follow up next week" and it automatically attaches it to the right customer.

And then location stuff! Like if you're at a customer site, it could automatically detect that and ask "are you meeting with this customer?" and start a meeting note. That would be so cool for field sales teams.

Oh and another thing, um, push notifications are huge on mobile right? So what if we had smarter notifications? Not just "you have a new ticket" but like "you haven't followed up with customer X in 3 weeks" or "contract renewal due in 7 days" - like proactive stuff.

I feel like... okay so here's the thing... everyone builds mobile apps that are just like worse versions of the desktop app. But mobile is actually better at some things! Quick capture, context awareness, notifications, camera, all that stuff. We should lean into that.

This could be a differentiator too because I looked at like... what are they called... Salesforce mobile and HubSpot mobile, and they're just like the desktop version but tiny. They don't really use mobile-native features well.

So maybe the mobile app isn't just "the dashboard on your phone" but like "the quick capture tool that syncs to the dashboard". Does that make sense? I think it does.

Need to talk to James about this, see if it's technically feasible. And Priya can probably... no wait Sarah... Sarah would know if customers would actually use this kind of thing.

Oh! And we could do offline mode! Like if you're in a basement meeting with no signal, you can still capture notes and photos and it syncs when you're back online. That would be massive for people who work in like... buildings with bad reception or whatever.

Anyway I should probably write this up properly when I get to the office but I wanted to... yeah... capture the idea while it's fresh.

Cool. Um. End recording? No wait -

One more thing! We could do a today widget. iOS has those widgets on the home screen, you could see your top priorities or like customers you need to follow up with, without even opening the app. That would be sick.

Okay now I'm done. [laugh] I need to stop having ideas on walks.
