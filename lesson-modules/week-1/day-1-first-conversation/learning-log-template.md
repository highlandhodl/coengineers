## Tips for Keeping Your Learning Log

1. **Be specific about prompts** - Copy the exact wording you used, not a paraphrase
2. **Note the context** - What were you trying to achieve? What files were involved?
3. **Record surprises** - Did Claude do something unexpected? That's valuable learning
4. **Track patterns** - After a few entries, look for what makes your prompts more effective
5. **Review weekly** - Spend 10 minutes each Friday looking back at your entries

## Example Entry

### Date: 9 December 2025

### Prompt I Used

```
Create a README.md file for my personal website project. It's built with Astro and includes a blog section.
```

### Response Summary

Claude Code created a comprehensive README with sections for installation, development commands, project structure, and deployment instructions. It included example commands and proper markdown formatting.

### What I Learned

- I don't need to specify every detail - Claude can infer common patterns
- README files follow a standard structure I can rely on
- Claude formats code blocks properly with syntax highlighting

### Things That Worked Well

- Mentioning the technology (Astro) gave Claude context for appropriate commands
- The README included sections I hadn't thought of (like Contributing guidelines)

### Things That Didn't Work As Expected

- It assumed I was deploying to Netlify, but I'm using Vercel
- Could have been more specific about my deployment setup

### Questions or Confusion

- Should I specify my deployment platform in the initial prompt?
- How much detail is too much when asking for documentation?

### What I'd Do Differently Next Time

Next time I'll mention my deployment platform upfront: "Create a README.md for my Astro website that deploys to Vercel."
