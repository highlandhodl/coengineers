## Content Strategy

### Theme: "What You Can Build in 1 Hour with Claude Code"

Each day showcases a different type of product/project someone built from scratch in 60 minutes or less. Real examples from our community, with step-by-step breakdowns.

**Why this works:**

- Concrete, inspiring examples (not theory)
- Challenges "you need months to build something" belief
- Shows breadth of what's possible
- Invites participation ("I could do that!")

### Thread Structure

Each thread follows the same format for consistency:

1. **Hook tweet** (strong opening, scrollstopper)
2. **The challenge** (what was built)
3. **The starting point** (skill level, tools known)
4. **The process** (3-5 key steps)
5. **The result** (screenshot/demo)
6. **The lesson** (key insight)
7. **Call to action** (try it yourself + link)

**Total length:** 8-10 tweets per thread

## Daily Content Breakdown

### Day 1 (Monday): Personal Dashboard

**Builder:** Sarah, Product Manager (non-developer)
**Project:** Personal productivity dashboard tracking daily habits, mood, and goals

**Story Arc:**

- Started with zero coding knowledge
- Frustrated with existing habit trackers (too complex or too simple)
- Spent 1 hour with Claude Code building custom dashboard
- Now uses it every morning
- Has added features 3 times since

**Key Elements to Highlight:**

- Simple tech stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (saved as local file)
- Claude explained every line of code
- No deployment needed - just opens in browser
- Customized to her exact needs (not generic template)

**Screenshots Needed:**

- Final dashboard interface
- Before (screenshot of old tool she used)
- Code snippet with Claude's explanation

**Lesson:** "You don't need to deploy to production to get value. Sometimes the best tools are the ones only you use."

### Day 2 (Tuesday): Data Analysis Script

**Builder:** Marcus, Management Consultant
**Project:** Python script that analyzes client data and generates weekly reports

**Story Arc:**

- Landed 2 clients who mentioned the site

**Key Elements to Highlight:**

- Started with MVP (just case studies, no CMS)

## Thread Writing Guidelines

### Voice & Tone

- **Conversational:** Write like you're explaining to a friend, not giving a formal presentation
- **Specific:** Use concrete details, not vague claims ("60 minutes" not "quickly")
- **Honest:** Include struggles and failures, not just wins
- **Encouraging:** Make readers think "I could do that" not "They're so smart"
- **British English:** Honour, optimise, etc.

### Hook Tweet Best Practices

Strong hooks use:

- **Specificity:** "Built a Slack bot in 60 min" > "Built something cool"
- **Transformation:** "From zero Python to automated reports"
- **Numbers:** "Saves me 5 hours every week"
- **Relatability:** "You know that annoying task...?"

**Examples of strong hooks:**

- "I spent 5 hours/week making Excel reports. Then I built a Python script in 60 minutes that does it automatically. Here's how (no coding background required):"
- "This Chrome extension saved my content research workflow. Built it in one hour with zero extension experience. Thread 🧵"
- "A product manager built a productivity dashboard. A consultant automated client reports. Both in ~1 hour. Both with no prior coding. Here's what they learned:"

### Tweet Structure

- **Length:** 200-280 characters ideal (leaves room for retweets)
- **Formatting:** Use line breaks for readability
- **Emphasis:** Use CAPS sparingly, bold when available
- **Hashtags:** Max 2 per thread, only on final tweet

### Visual Elements

Every thread needs:

- Screenshots (at least 3 per thread)
- Before/after comparisons when possible
- Code snippets (short, well-formatted)
- Optional: Video clip or GIF showing it working

### Call to Action

**Final tweet should include:**

1. Encouraging message ("You can build this too")
2. Link to resource (beta signup, template, guide)
3. Invitation to share ("What will you build?")
4. Relevant hashtags (#BuildInPublic #IndieHackers #ClaudeCode)

**Example CTA:**
"Want to try building your own project? We're opening beta access to Claude Command Studio next week - a visual builder for Claude Code workflows. Join the waitlist: [link]

What would you build in your first hour? Reply and tell me 👇"

## Cross-Posting Strategy

### Twitter/X

- Primary platform
- Post at 9am GMT (peak UK/EU audience)
- Engage with replies throughout the day
- Retweet community responses

### LinkedIn

- Cross-post with slight modifications:
  - More professional tone
  - Emphasize business value
  - Tag builders (if they have LinkedIn)
  - Post at 12pm GMT (lunch hour engagement)

## Engagement Plan

### During Campaign

- **Respond to all @mentions** within 2 hours during business hours
- **Amplify community stories:** If someone shares their build, retweet/quote
- **Create compilation:** End of week recap thread featuring community submissions
- **Live session:** Friday afternoon "build with us" session on Twitter Spaces

### After Campaign

- **Follow-up email** to beta signups (thank you + next steps)
- **Case study:** Turn best community stories into blog posts
- **Template library:** Create templates for the 5 projects featured
- **Video content:** Record walkthroughs of each build for YouTube

## Performance Tracking

### Metrics to Monitor

- Impressions per thread
- Engagement rate (likes + RTs + replies / impressions)
- Click-through rate on beta signup link
- Follower growth during campaign
- Signup attribution (UTM codes per thread)

### Success Benchmarks

- **Good:** 50K impressions/thread, 3% engagement, 50 signups/day
- **Great:** 100K impressions/thread, 5% engagement, 100 signups/day
- **Exceptional:** 200K+ impressions/thread, 8%+ engagement, 150+ signups/day

## Assets Needed

For each day's thread, provide:

1. **Full thread script** (8-10 tweets, ready to post)
2. **Image requirements** (descriptions of screenshots needed)
3. **Alternative hooks** (3 variations to A/B test)
4. **Reply templates** (common responses to anticipated questions)
5. **LinkedIn adaptation** (modified version for professional network)

## Brand Guidelines

### Visual Identity

- Screenshots should show CoEngine branding where appropriate
- Consistent colour scheme in any graphics (purple/blue)
- Professional but approachable aesthetic
- Credit builders (with permission)

### Legal/Ethical

- Get written permission from builders to share their stories
- Verify all claims (screenshots, timing, outcomes)
- Disclose beta signup is for CoEngine product
- No false scarcity ("only 100 spots!" if not true)

## Timeline

- **By Wednesday:** First 3 threads written and approved
- **By Friday:** All 5 threads complete, images sourced
- **Monday morning:** Campaign launches (Day 1 thread)
- **Friday afternoon:** Live Twitter Spaces build session
- **Following Monday:** Recap thread + campaign analysis

## Additional Context

- This is our first major social campaign
- Budget: £500 for sponsored tweets if organic performs well
- We have permission from all 5 builders featured
- Some screenshots are mockups (tools still in development)
- Community is primed - we teased this campaign last week
- Competitors watching - content needs to be genuinely helpful, not just promotional

## Success Example

For reference, here's the structure of a high-performing thread we can model:

**@ShipFastJohn's "Building in Public" thread:**

- Hook: Specific outcome + timeframe
- Story: Relatable starting point
- Process: 3-5 key steps, visual for each
- Result: Screenshot of working product
- Lesson: One clear takeaway
- CTA: Try it + engagement hook

**Performance:** 250K impressions, 12K likes, 800 RTs, 400 replies

## Deliverable

For each of 5 days, provide:

1. Complete thread (8-10 tweets with exact copy)
2. Image/screenshot descriptions
3. Engagement hooks (questions to seed discussion)
4. LinkedIn variant
5. Suggested reply templates

All content should be ready to copy-paste and post.
