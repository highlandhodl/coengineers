# Image Generation Brief: CoEngine Brand Assets

## Project Overview

Create a suite of AI-generated images for CoEngine's marketing website and social media presence. We need consistent, professional visuals that communicate our brand values: simplicity, power, and human-AI collaboration.

## Brand Identity

### Company Background

CoEngine is a productivity startup focused on making Claude Code accessible to everyone. We help people automate their work, enhance creativity, and build software faster using AI assistance.

### Brand Personality

- **Professional but approachable:** We're serious about productivity, but not stuffy
- **Human-centred:** Technology serves people, not the other way around
- **Empowering:** We help people do things they thought were impossible
- **Modern but timeless:** Contemporary design without trendy gimmicks

### Visual Style

- **Colour palette:**
  - Primary: Deep purple (#6B46C1)
  - Secondary: Electric blue (#3B82F6)
  - Accent: Coral pink (#F97583)
  - Neutrals: Dark charcoal (#1F2937), soft white (#F9FAFB)
- **Mood:** Calm, focused, sophisticated
- **Aesthetic:** Minimalist, clean, with thoughtful use of negative space
- **Lighting:** Soft, diffused lighting; avoid harsh shadows
- **Perspective:** Often slightly elevated or isometric views

## Image Requirements

We need prompts for the following images:

### 1. Hero Image - Landing Page

**Purpose:** Main visual on coengine.com homepage
**Dimensions:** 1920x1080px (16:9)
**Context:** Sits above the fold with headline "Build Faster with Claude Code"

**Concept:**
A person working at a modern desk with a laptop, surrounded by floating holographic interface elements representing automation workflows. The person should look focused but not stressed - conveying that work is flowing smoothly.

**Must include:**

- One person (diverse representation)
- Modern workspace (minimal desk, good lighting)
- Laptop showing code or visual workflows
- Floating/holographic UI elements (nodes, connections, data flows)
- Purple and blue colour scheme
- Sense of motion/flow without chaos

**Avoid:**

- Cluttered workspace
- Multiple people (keep focus on individual empowerment)
- Obvious stock photo aesthetics
- Overly futuristic/sci-fi vibes

### 2. Feature Illustration - Workflow Builder

**Purpose:** Product feature section on website
**Dimensions:** 1200x800px (3:2)
**Context:** Illustrate the visual workflow builder interface

**Concept:**
Abstract representation of a workflow as connected nodes and lines, similar to a mind map or flowchart, but beautiful and organic rather than rigid. Should feel like visual thinking made tangible.

**Must include:**

- 5-7 connected nodes in a flowing arrangement
- Directional arrows or connections between nodes
- Colour-coded elements (purple, blue, pink accents)
- Sense of depth (not completely flat)
- Clean, minimal background

**Avoid:**

- Corporate/boring flowchart aesthetic
- Too abstract (should be recognisable as a workflow)
- Symmetrical/rigid layouts

### 3. Social Media Hero - Twitter/LinkedIn

**Purpose:** Social media banner image
**Dimensions:** 1500x500px (3:1)
**Context:** Brand presence on social platforms

**Concept:**
Abstract composition of geometric shapes and flowing lines representing the concept of "human and AI working together". Left side: organic, human elements. Right side: geometric, AI elements. Middle: harmonious blend.

**Must include:**

- Gradient from organic to geometric (left to right)
- Purple and blue colour palette
- Sense of movement and energy
- Professional, modern aesthetic
- CoEngine logo space (will be overlaid)

**Avoid:**

- Literal representation of robots/computers
- Busy/cluttered composition
- Dark or moody tones

### 4. Blog Post Header Template

**Purpose:** Standard header for blog articles
**Dimensions:** 1200x630px (1.91:1, optimal for social sharing)
**Context:** Used across all blog posts with text overlay

**Concept:**
A versatile background that can accommodate text overlays. Should be visually interesting but not overwhelming - more of a texture or subtle pattern than a complete scene.

**Must include:**

- Gradient background (purple to blue)
- Subtle geometric patterns or shapes
- Enough visual interest to be attractive
- Enough simplicity to not compete with text
- Light areas where text will be placed

**Avoid:**

- Solid colours (too boring)
- Complex imagery (will fight with text)
- High contrast areas (makes text hard to read)

### 5. Product Screenshot Mockup Background

**Purpose:** Background for product screenshot compositions
**Dimensions:** 2400x1600px (3:2)
**Context:** Screenshots will be placed on top, floating above this background

**Concept:**
Soft, blurred background with subtle depth. Think of it as a stage for product screenshots - should enhance them without distraction.

**Must include:**

- Soft focus/blur effect
- Purple and blue tones (muted, not vibrant)
- Subtle gradients and light effects
- Sense of depth (like looking into a space)
- Professional, calm atmosphere

**Avoid:**

- Sharp details (should be background, not foreground)
- Bright, saturated colours
- Recognisable objects or scenes

### 6. Team/Community Image

**Purpose:** About page and community section
**Dimensions:** 1600x900px (16:9)
**Context:** Represents CoEngine's community of makers and builders

**Concept:**
Diverse group of people working collaboratively in a modern, bright space. Should feel authentic and energetic - real work is happening, but there's also connection and collaboration.

**Must include:**

- 3-5 people, diverse backgrounds
- Modern workspace with natural light
- Laptops and collaborative tools
- Energy and engagement (people interacting)
- Professional but relaxed atmosphere

**Avoid:**

- Staged/cheesy team photos
- Everyone staring at camera
- Corporate meeting room aesthetic
- Too casual/unprofessional

### 7. Success Story Illustration

**Purpose:** Customer success stories and case studies
**Dimensions:** 800x800px (1:1, for Instagram/social)
**Context:** Visual metaphor for transformation/success

**Concept:**
Abstract representation of growth or transformation. Before/after concept shown through visual metaphor (simple to complex, small to large, dark to light).

**Must include:**

- Clear sense of progression or transformation
- Optimistic, upward movement
- Purple to blue gradient representing the journey
- Clean, modern aesthetic
- Positive emotional tone

**Avoid:**

- Literal before/after photos
- Graphs or charts (too corporate)
- Overly abstract (must be emotionally clear)

## Technical Specifications

### File Format

- Primary: PNG with transparency where appropriate
- Secondary: JPEG for photographic images
- Resolution: 300 DPI for print, 72 DPI for web (provide both)

### Style Consistency

All images should:

- Use the same colour palette
- Share similar lighting/mood
- Feel like they belong to the same brand
- Work well together in compositions

### Accessibility Considerations

- Ensure sufficient contrast for text overlays
- Avoid relying solely on colour to convey meaning
- Consider how images appear to colourblind users

## Reference Inspiration

### Visual Style References

- **Linear:** Clean, minimal product imagery
- **Notion:** Friendly, accessible product illustrations
- **Stripe:** Professional, sophisticated brand photography
- **Figma:** Collaborative, energetic team imagery

### Mood References

- Calm productivity (morning coffee and laptop)
- Focused creation (maker in workshop)
- Thoughtful design (architect sketching)
- Collaborative energy (jam session, not corporate meeting)

## Deliverable

For each of the 7 images above, create:

1. **Detailed prompt** for AI image generation (Midjourney, DALL-E, Stable Diffusion)
2. **Technical parameters** (aspect ratio, style keywords, quality settings)
3. **Negative prompts** (what to avoid/exclude)
4. **Alternative variations** (2-3 prompt variations for each image)
5. **Post-processing notes** (any editing/adjustments needed)

## Success Criteria

Generated images should:

- Align with CoEngine brand identity
- Work effectively in their intended context
- Require minimal post-processing
- Feel cohesive as a collection
- Elevate the overall brand perception

## Additional Context

- We're a small startup (8 people), so budget for custom photography is limited
- AI-generated images are acceptable if they look professional
- We value authenticity over perfection
- Images should inspire people to build and create
- Avoid clichéd tech/startup imagery (ping pong tables, hoodies, etc.)

## Timeline

Need all 7 image prompts created by end of day for review. Will begin generation process immediately after approval.
