### Script Structure

**Intro (On Camera):**
"Hey, I'm Sarah from CoEngine. Today we're building a custom habit tracker from scratch in about 20 minutes. No coding experience required - I'll explain everything as we go.

By the end of this video, you'll have a working habit tracker deployed to the web that you can use on your phone or computer. More importantly, you'll understand the process of building custom tools, which you can apply to any problem you want to solve.

Let's dive in."

**Transitions Between Sections:**

- "Alright, now that we know what we're building..."
- "This is where it gets interesting..."
- "Almost done - just need to..."
- "And just like that, we have a working app!"

**Teaching Moments:**

- Pause to explain why we're doing something
- "You might be wondering why..." followed by clear explanation
- Point out patterns: "This is something you'll do in every project..."
- Acknowledge complexity, then simplify: "This looks complicated, but it's really just..."

**Outro (On Camera):**
"So there you have it - a custom habit tracker built in 20 minutes. You can customize this to track whatever matters to you, add reminders, build analytics, whatever you need.

The process we followed - describe the problem, break it down, build step by step - works for any project. Next week, we're building a client onboarding system.

If you build your own version, share it on Twitter and tag us @CoEngine. I'd love to see what you create.

Links to the template and Claude Command Studio are in the description. Thanks for watching!"
