# Audio Script Brief: CoEngine Podcast - "Building with Claude"

## Podcast Overview

**Show Name:** Building with Claude
**Format:** Interview-style podcast with builders, makers, and creators
**Episode Length:** 25-30 minutes
**Tone:** Conversational, curious, technically informed but accessible
**Audience:** Developers, product managers, designers, and technical creators

## This Episode: "From Spreadsheets to Shipped Products"

### Guest

**Name:** Marcus Rodriguez
**Background:** Former management consultant turned indie maker
**Credibility:** Built and sold 3 micro-SaaS products in 18 months using Claude Code

**Why this guest:**

- Represents our target audience (non-traditional developer)
- Compelling transformation story (Excel warrior → shipping products)
- Practical, actionable insights (not theoretical)
- Relatable struggles and wins

### Episode Goal

Show listeners that **you don't need a traditional engineering background to build and ship real products** when you collaborate effectively with Claude Code.

**Key takeaways:**

1. The skills you already have (problem-solving, domain knowledge) matter more than you think
2. Claude Code changes the learning curve for technical skills
3. Shipping products is about persistence and iteration, not genius
4. You can validate ideas faster when you can build prototypes yourself

## Episode Structure

### 1. Cold Open (90 seconds)

**Purpose:** Hook listeners immediately with the most compelling moment

Start with Marcus describing the moment he shipped his first paying customer - the emotions, the surprise, the "holy shit this actually works" feeling. Should be authentic and vulnerable.

**Tone:** Energetic, authentic, slightly vulnerable
**Content:** A specific, vivid memory (not generic inspiration)

- When to push back on Claude's suggestions
- The importance of understanding what code does (even if you didn't write it)
- Building in public and getting feedback early

**Tone:** Reflective, generous with lessons
**Content:** Actionable advice, not platitudes

### 6. Scaling Up (4-5 minutes)

**Host questions:**

- You've now built and sold 3 products - what changed?

**Host questions:**

- What would you tell someone who's thinking about building their first product?
- What's the minimum viable mindset needed to succeed?
- How do you recommend people get started with Claude Code?

**Marcus should cover:**

- Start with a problem you personally have
- Don't wait to learn everything - learn by building

## Script Requirements

### Format

- **Host dialogue:** Clear questions and transitions
- **Guest dialogue:** Suggested talking points and stories (not word-for-word script)
- **Production notes:** [Sound effects], [Music cues], [Timing notes]
- **Alternative paths:** If conversation goes in different direction, provide optional follow-up questions

### Voice & Style

**Host (Sarah):**

- Curious and engaged (genuinely interested, not performing)
- Asks follow-up questions based on what guest says
- Technical enough to understand deeply, but asks questions for audience benefit
- Warm, encouraging, occasionally playful
- British English throughout

**Guest (Marcus):**

- Authentic and conversational (not polished/rehearsed)
- Specific and detailed (stories > abstractions)
- Humble about wins, honest about struggles
- Occasionally technical but always translates to plain language
- Enthusiastic but not salesy

### Production Notes

**Music:**

- Upbeat, modern electronic intro/outro (30 seconds)
- Subtle background music during introduction only
- Clean audio for main conversation (no background music)

**Pacing:**

- Natural conversation speed (not rushed)
- Strategic pauses for emphasis
- Edit out excessive filler words, but keep some for authenticity
- Total length: 25-30 minutes (strict)

**Sound Design:**

- Minimal - this is about the conversation
- Subtle transition sounds between sections
- No distracting effects

## Key Messages to Emphasize

1. **You don't need traditional CS background** - Marcus is proof
2. **Start with problems you understand** - domain knowledge > technical knowledge
3. **Ship early and often** - perfect is the enemy of shipped
4. **Claude Code as collaborator AND teacher** - not just a code generator
5. **Small wins build momentum** - Marcus's first product was tiny

## Quotes to Include

(These should emerge naturally in conversation, but make sure we get versions of these)

- "I went from being scared of the terminal to shipping products in 6 months. That's not because I'm special - it's because the tools changed."
- "My first version was so bad I was embarrassed to show anyone. But it solved the problem, and that's all that mattered."
- "Claude doesn't write your code for you - it teaches you to think like a developer while you're building."
- "The best business idea is the one you actually ship. I had a dozen 'better' ideas in my head that never went anywhere."

## Research & Prep

**Background to reference:**

- Marcus's products: TimeboxCRM, ProposalFlow, NoteWeaver
- His writing: Personal blog (marcusmakes.com - fictional)
- His presence: Active on Twitter/X, shares revenue numbers publicly
- Philosophy: "Build in public" advocate, transparency about failures

**Technical context:**

- Marcus uses: Next.js, Supabase, Tailwind (all learned via Claude Code)
- Never took formal programming courses
- Started building at age 34 (after 10 years in consulting)
- Currently teaching others via cohort-based course

## Success Criteria

This script should:

- Feel like a natural, authentic conversation (not an interview)
- Provide specific, actionable insights (not vague inspiration)
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Inspire listeners to start building
- Showcase Claude Code's potential without being an ad
- Run 25-30 minutes when recorded at natural conversation pace

## Deliverable

Please provide:
