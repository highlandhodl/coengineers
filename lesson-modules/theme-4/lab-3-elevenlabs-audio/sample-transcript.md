## Week 1: Welcome to Your AI Productivity Journey

Hello, and welcome to CoEngineers! I'm absolutely delighted you've decided to join us on this 31-day journey into AI-powered productivity.

If you're feeling a bit nervous about learning technical skills, let me reassure you straight away: this course is designed for people just like you. You don't need any coding experience, you don't need to be technical, and you definitely don't need to be an engineer. What you do need is curiosity, a willingness to learn, and about 30 minutes a day to practise.

### What You'll Accomplish This Week

This first week is all about building your foundation. Think of it like learning to drive—before you hit the motorway, you need to understand the basics. We'll start with the command line, which I know sounds intimidating, but I promise it's simpler than it looks.

By the end of Week 1, you'll be able to navigate your computer using text commands, create and organise files, and use Claude Code to help with everyday tasks. These are the building blocks for everything else we'll do together.

### Why This Matters

Let me tell you why this is worth your time. I've watched product managers reduce their weekly reporting time from 4 hours to 30 minutes. I've seen content creators batch-produce a month's worth of social media posts in a single afternoon. Knowledge workers who used to dread tedious data entry now automate it completely.

This isn't about replacing your expertise—it's about amplifying it. You're brilliant at what you do. Claude Code simply handles the repetitive bits so you can focus on the work that actually requires your unique skills and judgement.

### How to Succeed

Here's my advice for getting the most out of this course. First, do the labs. Reading about swimming doesn't make you a swimmer—you need to get in the water. The same applies here. Each lab takes 20 to 30 minutes, and that hands-on practice is where the real learning happens.

Second, don't worry about making mistakes. You're working in a safe practice environment. Nothing you do in the lab exercises will break your computer or delete important files. If something goes wrong, that's actually good—it means you're pushing your boundaries and learning.

Third, ask questions. If you're confused about something, someone else probably is too. Use the community forum, send us a message, or leave a comment. We're here to help, and there's no such thing as a silly question.

### What Makes This Course Different

You might be wondering what makes CoEngineers different from other AI courses. Three things, really.

First, we focus exclusively on real-world applications. You won't spend time on theory for theory's sake. Every single lesson teaches you something you can use in your actual work the very same day.

Second, we assume you're not technical. Many AI courses are created by engineers for engineers. We're different. I explain things in plain language, I don't assume prior knowledge, and I celebrate your progress every step of the way.

Third, we're opinionated about workflow. We don't just show you what's possible—we show you the best way to do things based on thousands of hours of real-world usage. You'll learn proven patterns that actually work in professional settings.

### Your Week 1 Labs

You've got five labs waiting for you this week. Day 1 introduces you to the command line basics—navigating directories and understanding file paths. Day 2 covers file operations like creating, moving, and renaming files. Day 3 teaches you reading and searching through files. Day 4 is all about system information and environment variables. And Day 5 brings it all together in your first real workflow.

Each lab follows the same structure: I'll explain the concept, demonstrate it, and then you'll practise it yourself with my guidance. The labs build on each other, so try to complete them in order.

### Looking Ahead

After you finish Week 1, Week 2 focuses on content processing—meetings, voice notes, PDFs, and web content. Week 3 is about creative outputs like presentations and images. Week 4 teaches you actual software development, which sounds scary but is surprisingly accessible with Claude Code's help. And the final bonus week introduces advanced frameworks like the BMAD Method for product development.

But don't worry about all that now. Focus on Week 1. Master the basics. Build your confidence. Everything else will follow naturally.

### Final Thoughts

I want you to think about one task in your work that feels tedious or time-consuming. Maybe it's formatting reports, maybe it's data entry, maybe it's creating presentations. Keep that task in mind as you go through this course. By Week 3, I'd wager you'll have figured out how to streamline or automate it completely.

That's the power of what you're learning. This isn't just about understanding AI—it's about reclaiming your time, reducing frustration, and focusing on work that genuinely matters to you.

Right, I've talked long enough. It's time for you to get started. Head over to Day 1, Lab 1, and let's begin your journey. I'll be right there with you, guiding you through every step.

Welcome to CoEngineers. Let's make you brilliantly productive.

## Notes for Audio Conversion

**Pacing:**

- Speak slightly slower than normal conversation (allows time to absorb information)
- Pause for 1-2 seconds between major sections
- Emphasise key phrases like "you don't need any coding experience" and "real-world applications"

**Tone:**

- Warm and encouraging throughout
- Confident but never condescending
- British English pronunciation (prioritise, organisation, programme)
- Natural, conversational delivery (not scripted-sounding)

**Technical Considerations:**

- Total word count: ~950 words
- Expected duration at 150 words/minute: 6-7 minutes
- Expected duration at 180 words/minute (slightly faster): 5-6 minutes
- Optimal pace: 160-170 words/minute for instructional content

**ElevenLabs Settings Recommendations:**

- Voice: Choose a professional, warm, British English voice (e.g., "Daniel" or "Charlotte")
- Stability: 60-70% (allows natural variation without sounding robotic)
- Clarity: 75-80% (emphasises clear pronunciation for instructional content)
- Style: 40-50% (maintains conversational tone)

**File Format:**

- MP3 (most compatible across platforms)
- 44.1 kHz sample rate
- 128-192 kbps bitrate (good quality, reasonable file size)
- Mono audio (sufficient for voice-only content)
