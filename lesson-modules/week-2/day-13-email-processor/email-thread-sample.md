# Email Thread Sample - Project Handover Discussion

Hi both,

Thanks for the quick responses. Just to clarify a few points:

@James - Yes, please do schedule that handover call with Marcus. Wednesday afternoon works best for me. Can you send a calendar invite with the Zoom link?

@Alex - The documentation you mentioned is in the Google Drive folder, but I think it's out of date. The client made significant changes to their requirements in November and I'm not sure we captured all of them. We should probably review and update before the handover.

A few other things to sort out before we transition this:

1. Admin access - Marcus needs to be added as an admin on their account. Currently only I have that level of access.
2. Billing - We need to confirm they're happy to move from monthly to annual billing. They mentioned it last week but I haven't got written confirmation yet.
3. Custom reports - They've been asking about custom reporting. This isn't something we typically offer but they're willing to pay extra. Priya, thoughts on feasibility?

Let me know if you need anything else from me before the handover.

Cheers,
Sarah

Sarah,

I've reviewed the Acme Corp account and everything looks good from a technical perspective. Their data migration completed successfully last week and they've been actively using the system.

A few notes:

- They have 23 active users (up from 15 when they started)
- They're using about 60% of their storage allocation
- No major support tickets in the last month
- They've set up custom fields for their industry-specific data (this was a big win for them)

The documentation is in the shared Google Drive folder under "Client Handovers > Acme Corp". I've included:

- Account setup details
- Custom configuration notes
- Integration points with their existing systems
- Contact list with roles and responsibilities

One thing to flag: Their IT team has been asking about API access for their internal dashboard. We should discuss if this is something we want to enable for them.

Happy to join the handover call if needed.

Alex

Hi Sarah,

Thanks for the heads up. I've been CC'd on a few of their support emails so I have some context already.

Quick questions:

1. Do they have any ongoing issues I should be aware of?
2. What's the best way to reach Marcus - email, phone, Slack?
3. Should I schedule a formal handover call or is email sufficient?

I'll review their account history and recent interactions today. Let me know if there's anything specific you want me to focus on during the transition.

**Date:** 8 December 2025, 16:45 GMT

Hi team,

I'm transitioning the Acme Corp account to James, effective next week. Sarah is going on maternity leave from the 16th (earlier than planned - baby has other ideas!).

Acme Corp has been a client for 6 months and they're one of our bigger accounts (£2,400/month). The main contact is Marcus Thompson (marcus.thompson@acmecorp.com) - he's Head of Operations and very responsive.

Key things to know:

**Account Overview:**

- Industry: Manufacturing
- Team size: ~25 users
- Primary use case: Customer relationship management and project tracking
- They're on our Professional plan with custom field add-on

**Recent History:**

- Onboarded in June 2025
- Had some initial challenges with data migration but those are all resolved now
- Very happy with the product - they've already referred two other companies to us
- Considering upgrading to Enterprise tier in Q1 2026

**Ongoing Items:**

- Monthly check-in calls (usually first Tuesday of each month at 2pm)
- They submit a few support tickets per week - usually quick questions, nothing major
- Marcus likes detailed responses with screenshots/videos when possible

**Watch Outs:**

- Their finance team is very particular about invoicing - make sure invoices are sent by the 1st of each month
- They have strict security requirements - any new integrations need to go through their IT approval process (can take 2-3 weeks)
- Marcus travels a lot in Asia so early morning UK time is often best for calls

I'll introduce you both via email tomorrow. James will be the main point of contact going forward, with Alex providing technical support as needed.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Sarah

All,

Re: custom reporting for Acme Corp - this is definitely feasible. We've built custom reports for two other enterprise clients.

The scope depends on what they need:

- Simple custom dashboards: 2-3 days development, ~£2,500
- Complex multi-source reports: 1-2 weeks development, ~£8,000
- Ongoing custom report building: We could offer this as a retainer add-on

@James - When you have the handover call with Marcus, can you find out specifically what reporting they need? Once we have requirements I can put together a proper proposal and timeline.

Also, congratulations Sarah on the early arrival! Very exciting. Don't worry about Acme Corp, we've got this covered.

Thanks everyone! This is really helpful.

@James - I've just sent you a calendar invite for Wednesday at 2pm with Marcus. I'll join for the first 15 minutes to do introductions, then hand over to you.

@Alex - Good catch on the documentation being out of date. Can you update it by Tuesday? Particularly the section on their custom fields setup - that's changed quite a bit.

@Priya - Marcus mentioned wanting to track:

- Monthly sales performance by product category
- Customer acquisition cost by channel
- Project profitability (they track time and expenses in our system)
- Customer lifetime value trends

He showed me an Excel spreadsheet they're currently using - it's... complex. Definitely worth a proper scoping call. Maybe join the Wednesday handover?

On the API access question - I think this is a good candidate for it. They're technically sophisticated and have legitimate integration needs. @Priya can we enable API access for Enterprise tier clients?

Right, I need to finish about 17 other handovers before this baby arrives, so I'll sign off for now!

Perfect, I've accepted the calendar invite for Wednesday.

I'll prepare for the call by:

- Reviewing their account history and support tickets
- Looking at their current usage patterns and custom setup
- Preparing questions about their reporting needs
- Checking on the annual billing status

@Priya - Yes please join the Wednesday call. Would be great to have you there for the reporting discussion.

@Alex - I'll review the updated documentation once you've finished it. If you're free Tuesday afternoon we could do a quick 30-min sync on any technical gotchas I should know about?

@Sarah - You've done a great job with this account. I'll make sure we keep them just as happy. And seriously, congratulations! Very exciting times ahead for you.

All - I'll send a summary email after Wednesday's call with next steps.

James
