## Email 2

**From:** Marcus Thompson <marcus.thompson@acmecorp.com>
**To:** me@example.com
**Subject:** Quick question about user permissions
**Date:** 9 December 2025, 09:42

Hi,

Hope you're well! Quick question - we've just hired a new team member (Lisa Davis) and I want to give her access to view customer records but not edit them. I can't see a "view only" permission option in the user settings.

Is this possible? If not, is it on your roadmap?

Also, while I have you - when's the next product update? We're excited about the mobile app you mentioned!

Cheers,
Marcus

## Email 11

**From:** Alex Rivera <alex.rivera@techconsult.co.uk>
**To:** me@example.com
**Subject:** RE: PR #47 - Couple of suggestions
**Date:** 9 December 2025, 14:22

Hey,

I looked at your review comments on PR #47. Good catches! I've made the changes:

1. ✅ Updated the SQL query to use parameterized inputs (security fix you mentioned)
2. ✅ Added error handling for empty search strings
3. ✅ Changed the index to use GIN instead of B-tree (better for text search)

The one about pagination - I agree we'll need it eventually but wanted to keep this PR focused on just getting search working. Should I add a TODO comment and create a ticket for pagination in the next sprint?

Also while I was in there I noticed the search timeout is set to 5 seconds which seems long. Dropped it to 2 seconds. Let me know if that's too aggressive.

Re-requested your review!

Alex
