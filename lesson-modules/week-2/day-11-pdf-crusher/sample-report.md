## Net Promoter Score (NPS) Analysis

### Overall NPS: 42

**Breakdown:**

- Promoters (9-10): 56%
- Passives (7-8): 30%
- Detractors (0-6): 14%

### Quarter-over-Quarter Trend

| Quarter | NPS | Change |
| ------- | --- | ------ |
| Q1 2025 | 35  | -      |
| Q2 2025 | 37  | +2     |
| Q3 2025 | 38  | +1     |
| Q4 2025 | 42  | +4     |

**Analysis:** NPS has shown consistent growth throughout 2025, with Q4 showing the largest single-quarter improvement. This correlates with improvements in support response times and the launch of the enhanced ticket management system.

### NPS by Customer Segment

- **Small Business:** NPS 45 (59% promoters)
- **Mid-Market:** NPS 41 (54% promoters)
- **Enterprise:** NPS 37 (48% promoters)

**Insight:** Small business customers are most satisfied, likely due to better product-market fit for their use cases. Enterprise customers have lower NPS, primarily citing the need for custom fields and advanced permissions as gaps.

### NPS by Customer Tenure

- **0-3 months:** NPS 48 (new customer onboarding is strong)
- **3-6 months:** NPS 44
- **6-12 months:** NPS 40
- **12+ months:** NPS 38

**Insight:** NPS declines slightly with tenure, suggesting that while initial experience is excellent, longer-term customers encounter limitations as their needs become more sophisticated. This supports the need for advanced features development.

## Customer Satisfaction Score (CSAT)

### Overall CSAT: 4.2/5

**CSAT by Touchpoint:**

| Touchpoint            | Score | Sample Size |
| --------------------- | ----- | ----------- |
| Onboarding Experience | 4.5/5 | 342         |
| Support Interactions  | 4.4/5 | 891         |
| Product Usability     | 4.2/5 | 1,834       |
| Feature Requests      | 3.8/5 | 623         |
| Documentation         | 4.0/5 | 445         |

**Analysis:** Onboarding and support receive highest satisfaction scores. Feature requests receive lowest scores, indicating that customers want functionality we don't yet offer. This is expected and healthy - it shows engagement and growth potential.

### Support Response Time Impact

Following the expansion of our support team in September 2025:

- **Average first response time:** 2.3 hours (down from 3.5 hours in Q3)
- **Average resolution time:** 8.1 hours (down from 12.4 hours in Q3)
- **Support CSAT:** 4.4/5 (up from 4.0/5 in Q3)

**Clear correlation** between faster response times and higher satisfaction. Customers specifically mentioned "quick support" as a reason for high NPS scores in 89 interview responses.

## Competitive Comparison

### How We Compare (based on customer interviews with people who evaluated competitors)

**vs. Salesforce:**

- ✅ Much easier to use
- ✅ Significantly cheaper
- ❌ Fewer features
- ❌ Less customisable

**vs. HubSpot:**

- ✅ Better value for money
- ✅ Cleaner interface
- ❌ Less marketing automation
- ❌ Weaker mobile experience

**vs. Pipedrive:**

- ✅ Better support

Our "sweet spot" is small to mid-sized businesses who value ease of use over feature depth. To move upmarket, we need to add sophistication without sacrificing simplicity.
