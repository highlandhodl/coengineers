## What You'll Build

By the end of this theme, you'll be able to transform any raw content into polished Obsidian notes:

- Meeting transcripts → Action items and decisions
- Voice memos → Structured notes with key points
- Email threads → Summarised insights
- Research dumps → Organised knowledge
- YouTube videos → Timestamped summaries
