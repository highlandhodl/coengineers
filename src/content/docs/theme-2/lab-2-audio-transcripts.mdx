## Start the Lab

<SlashCommand code="/t2.lb2" label="Begin Lab 2" />

## What You'll Learn

- Transform raw voice transcriptions into polished written content
- Remove filler words and false starts whilst preserving meaning
- Restructure rambling thoughts into clear paragraphs
- Choose appropriate cleanup levels for different contexts
- Process multiple transcripts to identify themes

## Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                               |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Filler Removal**       | Eliminating "um", "like", "you know" without losing authenticity          |
| **False Start Cleanup**  | Converting "So I was thinking... well actually..." into coherent thoughts |
| **Cleanup Levels**       | Light (conversational), Medium (polished), Heavy (formal)                 |
| **Voice Preservation**   | Maintaining the speaker's tone and intent during transformation           |
| **Batch Theme Analysis** | Processing multiple voice memos to spot recurring ideas                   |

## What You'll Create

By the end of this lab, you'll have:

- Polished documents from raw voice transcripts
- Understanding of different cleanup levels
- Ability to batch-process voice notes for pattern recognition

## Real-World Applications

- **Voice Memos:** Convert morning walk ideas into actionable notes
- **Interview Recordings:** Clean up customer or research interviews
- **Podcast Scripts:** Transform recorded thoughts into written episodes
- **Meeting Transcripts:** Process Otter.ai or Fireflies outputs
- **Content Creation:** Turn voice brainstorms into blog posts or videos
