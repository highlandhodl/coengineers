| **Multi-Source Synthesis** | Combining insights from multiple articles on the same topic     |
| **Adaptive Structure**     | Tailoring note format to content type (tutorial, opinion, news) |
| **Cross-Referencing**      | Linking notes to build a personal knowledge graph               |

## What You'll Create

By the end of this lab, you'll have:

- Structured reading notes from web content
- Multi-source research synthesis
- Framework for building a personal knowledge base

## Real-World Applications
