## About the Course

### What is this course about?

31 Days of Claude Code teaches you how to use Claude Code — Anthropic's command-line AI assistant — to automate your daily work. You'll learn to process content, create documents, and build software, all without writing code yourself.

### Who is this course for?

- **Product managers** wanting to automate repetitive tasks
- **Content creators** processing videos, articles, and research
- **Knowledge workers** managing information overload
- **Anyone** curious about AI-assisted productivity

### Do I need coding experience?

**No.** This course is designed for non-programmers. You'll use the terminal (command line), but we'll teach you everything you need. The commands are mostly copy-paste.

That said, if you _can_ code, you'll get even more out of the course — Week 4 covers spec-driven software development.

### How long does each lesson take?

Most lessons take **20-30 minutes**:

- ~5 minutes to watch/read the content
- ~15-20 minutes to complete the exercise
- Optional: extra time to experiment

Some lessons (like Week 4's software building) may take longer as you get into larger projects.

### Can I do this course at my own pace?

**Absolutely.** While it's called "31 Days", there's no deadline. Lessons will remain available forever. Do one a day, one a week, or binge them all — whatever works for you.

### What if I fall behind?

There's no "behind" — go at your own pace. The course will always be here. If you subscribed for daily emails, you can catch up anytime using the website.

## Technical Requirements

### What do I need to get started?

The essentials:

- A computer (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
- Internet connection
- 15-30 minutes per day

For the exercises:

- Node.js 18+ (we'll help you install it)
- Claude Code CLI (free to install)
- An Anthropic API key (pay-as-you-go)

See the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/prerequisites) page for full details.

### Does Claude Code cost money?

**Claude Code itself is free** to install and use.

However, it uses the **Anthropic API**, which is pay-as-you-go:

- You pay per token (roughly per word)
- Typical usage: a few pounds/dollars per month
- No subscription required

Most learners spend £2-5 per month during the course.

### What operating systems are supported?

- **macOS** — Full support
- **Windows** — Full support (via Command Prompt or PowerShell)
- **Linux** — Full support

All exercises work identically across platforms.

### Can I use my phone or tablet?

**Not for the exercises.** Claude Code requires a proper terminal, which phones and tablets don't have. You can read the lessons on any device, but you'll need a computer for the hands-on parts.

## Course Content

### Are the lessons video or text?

**Both.** Each lesson includes:

- A short video explaining the concept
- Written content you can reference
- An interactive slash command for the exercise
- Optional further reading

You can learn from whichever format suits you.

### Can I download the lessons?

The lesson text is always available on the website. Videos are hosted on YouTube — you can use YouTube's offline features if needed.

We don't currently offer downloadable PDFs, but the website works offline once pages are loaded.

### Will the content be updated?

**Yes.** Claude Code evolves quickly, and we'll update lessons to reflect new features and best practices. Major updates will be announced via email.

Subscribed users get notified of significant changes.

### Are there exercises or projects?

Every lesson includes a hands-on exercise using a slash command. You'll build real things:

- Week 1: Your personal productivity system
- Week 2: Content processing workflows
- Week 3: Creative output generators
- Week 4: A complete software feature
- Bonus: A capstone project
