Getting stuck is a normal part of learning. This guide covers the most common issues you might encounter and how to fix them.

---

## Installation Issues

### Claude Code Not Recognised After Install

**Symptom:** You type `claude` in your terminal and get "command not found".

**Solutions:**

1. **Close and reopen your terminal** — The install adds Claude Code to your PATH, but existing terminals don't see it automatically.

2. **Check the installation completed** — Run the installer again:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

3. **Verify it's installed** — Check npm's global packages:

   ```bash
   npm list -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
   ```

4. **Manually add to PATH** (advanced) — If Claude Code installed but isn't found, you may need to add npm's global bin directory to your PATH.

### Permission Denied Errors

**Symptom:** You see `EACCES` or "permission denied" when installing.

**Solutions:**

**macOS/Linux:**

```bash
# Fix npm permissions (recommended)
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
echo 'export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

**Windows:**

- Run Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
- Or use Node Version Manager (nvm) which avoids permission issues

### Node.js Version Issues

**Symptom:** Claude Code won't install or run, mentioning Node.js version.

**Check your version:**

```bash
node --version
```

**Required:** Node.js 18 or higher

**To upgrade:**

- **macOS:** `brew install node` or download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Windows:** Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
- **Linux:** Use your package manager or [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

### API Key Not Working

**Symptom:** Claude Code says your API key is invalid or you get authentication errors.

**Check these:**

1. **Correct key:** Anthropic API keys start with `sk-ant-`. Make sure you're not using a different service's key.

2. **No extra spaces:** When copying your key, ensure there are no leading or trailing spaces.

3. **Environment variable set:**

   ```bash
   # Check if it's set
   echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY

   # Set it (add to your shell config file)
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-your-key-here"
   ```

4. **Key not expired:** Check your [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com) to ensure the key is still valid.

## Slash Command Issues

### Command Not Found

**Symptom:** You type a slash command like `/w1.d1` and Claude Code says it doesn't exist.

**Solutions:**

1. **Are you in the right project?** — Slash commands are project-specific. Make sure you're in the CoEngineers project folder:

   ```bash
   pwd  # Should show the coengineers folder
   ```

2. **Did you clone the repository?** — Commands live in `.claude/commands/`. If you downloaded files manually, you might be missing them.

3. **Check the file exists:**
   ```bash
   ls .claude/commands/w1.d1.md
   ```

### Command Produces Unexpected Output

**Symptom:** The command runs but doesn't do what the lesson describes.

**Things to check:**

1. **Read the lesson first** — Some commands need context from the lesson to make sense.

2. **Answer the questions** — Many commands ask questions before generating output. Make sure you're providing the information it asks for.

3. **Check your inputs** — If the output seems wrong, try running the command again with different answers.

### Custom Commands Not Loading

**Symptom:** Commands you created aren't being recognised.

**Verify:**

1. **File location:** Custom commands must be in `.claude/commands/` directory

2. **File extension:** Must be `.md` (markdown)

3. **File name:** Becomes the command name (e.g., `mycommand.md` → `/mycommand`)

4. **Restart Claude Code:** After adding new commands, you may need to restart.

## Course Content Issues

### Videos Not Playing

**Symptom:** Video embeds show errors or won't load.

**Try these:**

1. **Check your internet connection** — Videos stream from YouTube

2. **Disable ad blockers** — Some ad blockers prevent video embeds

3. **Try a different browser** — Chrome, Firefox, and Safari all work

4. **Open on YouTube directly** — Click the YouTube logo in the player

### Code Examples Not Working

**Symptom:** Copy-pasting code from lessons produces errors.

**Common causes:**

1. **Smart quotes:** Some browsers convert `"` to `"` or `"`. Use a code editor that converts them back.

2. **Indentation:** Python is sensitive to spaces vs tabs. Ensure consistent indentation.

3. **Missing dependencies:** Check if the lesson mentions packages to install first.

4. **Different file location:** Make sure you're in the right folder when running commands.

### Links Not Working

**Symptom:** Clicking a link gives a 404 error or goes nowhere.

**What to do:**

1. **Report it** — Email us at john@coengineers.ai with the page and broken link

2. **Try the URL manually** — Sometimes the link text shows the intended destination

3. **Check if the page exists** — Use the sidebar to navigate to similar content

## Email Issues

### Welcome Email Not Received

**Symptom:** You signed up but never got the welcome email.

**Check these:**

1. **Spam/Junk folder** — Most common! Check your spam folder and mark us as "not spam"

2. **Correct email** — Did you type your email correctly? Try signing up again if unsure.

3. **Give it time** — Email can take up to 5 minutes to arrive

4. **Check Promotions tab** — Gmail users: check the Promotions tab

### Unsubscribe Link Not Working

**Symptom:** Clicking unsubscribe shows an error.

**What to try:**

1. **Copy the full link** — Sometimes email clients truncate long URLs. Try copying and pasting the full link.

2. **Use a different browser** — Your email app's built-in browser might have issues.

3. **Email us** — If all else fails, email john@coengineers.ai and we'll unsubscribe you manually.

### Not Receiving Updates

**Symptom:** You're subscribed but not getting new lesson notifications.

**Possible reasons:**

1. **Check spam regularly** — Email filters learn over time and might start filtering us

2. **You unsubscribed** — Try signing up again on the homepage

3. **Lessons haven't launched yet** — The full course launches January 2026

## Browser/Device Issues

### Site Not Loading Properly

**Symptom:** Page looks broken, missing styles, or shows errors.

**Solutions:**

1. **Hard refresh:**
   - **Mac:** Cmd + Shift + R
   - **Windows:** Ctrl + Shift + R
   - This clears cached files

2. **Clear cache:** In browser settings, clear cached images and files

3. **Try incognito/private mode:** This rules out extensions causing issues

4. **Update your browser:** Ensure you're on a recent version

### Navigation Not Working on Mobile

**Symptom:** Menu won't open, or pages don't load on your phone.

**Try:**

1. **Tap the hamburger menu (☰)** — On mobile, the sidebar is hidden behind this icon

2. **Rotate your phone** — Some layouts work better in landscape

3. **Request desktop site** — In your browser's menu, try "Request Desktop Site"

4. **Use a different browser** — Safari, Chrome, and Firefox all support the site

### Content Cut Off

**Symptom:** Text or images are partially hidden.

**Fixes:**

1. **Scroll horizontally** — Code blocks can scroll left/right

2. **Zoom out:** Pinch to zoom out on mobile, or Cmd/Ctrl + minus on desktop

3. **Check orientation** — Some content displays better in landscape

4. **Resize browser window** — On desktop, try making the window wider
