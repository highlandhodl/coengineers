## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conversational AI** | Claude Code is not a command system - it's a conversation partner  |
| **Specificity**       | The more detail you provide, the better the response               |
| **Clarification**     | Claude asks questions to ensure it gives you exactly what you need |
| **Iteration**         | Refining outputs through back-and-forth dialogue is normal         |

## What You'll Create

- `learning-log.md` - A personalised learning journal with space for daily observations, prompts that worked well, and questions for tomorrow

## Real-World Applications

- Getting help with any task by simply describing what you need
- Creating files and documents through conversation
- Building confidence with AI tools before tackling complex workflows
