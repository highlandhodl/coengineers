## What You'll Learn

- Add YAML frontmatter to your Obsidian notes
- Create a consistent tagging system
- Use Claude Code to enrich existing notes with metadata
- Build queries to find notes based on metadata

## Key Concepts

| Concept         | Description                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontmatter** | YAML block at the start of a markdown file containing metadata |
| **Tags**        | Labels that categorise and connect related notes               |
| **Properties**  | Custom fields like `status`, `project`, or `due-date`          |
| **Dataview**    | Obsidian plugin that queries notes based on metadata           |

## What You'll Create

- A metadata schema for your notes (standard properties to use)
- Enriched versions of existing notes with proper frontmatter
- A tagging convention that works across your vault

## Real-World Applications

- Find all notes related to a specific project instantly
- Track the status of tasks and documents
