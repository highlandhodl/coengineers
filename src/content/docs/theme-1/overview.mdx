import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## What You'll Build

By the end of this theme, you'll have a fully configured Obsidian vault with:

- A PARA folder structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Reusable document templates
- Standardised metadata for all your notes
- A CLAUDE.md file that gives Claude Code context about your project

## The Five Labs
