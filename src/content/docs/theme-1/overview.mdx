import { LinkCard, CardGrid } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

## What You'll Build

By the end of this theme, you'll have a fully configured Obsidian vault with:

- A PARA folder structure (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives)
- Project-specific folder organisation for different work types
- Reusable document templates
- Standardised metadata for all your notes
