## Start the Lab

<SlashCommand code="/t1.lb3" label="Begin organising your project folders" />

## What You'll Learn

- How to design folder structures for different project types
- Organisation patterns for customer projects, learning materials, and reference content
- Best practices for naming conventions and hierarchy
- Using Claude Code to scaffold folder structures automatically

## Key Concepts

| Concept                | Description                                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Folders**    | Dedicated directories for client work with discovery, strategy, delivery, and output phases |
| **Learning Folders**   | Organised spaces for courses, exercises, and reference materials                            |
| **Reference Folders**  | Central locations for templates, brand assets, and archived content                         |
| **Naming Conventions** | Consistent patterns for folder names that aid discoverability                               |

## What You'll Create

- `folder-structure-examples.md` - Reference guide showing folder patterns for different project types
- Custom folder structure scaffolded for your actual projects

## Real-World Applications

- Setting up new client projects with consistent organisation
- Creating learning repositories for courses and professional development
- Building reference libraries for templates and frequently-used assets
- Maintaining archive structures for completed work
