## Key Concepts

| Concept       | Description                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Projects**  | Short-term efforts with clear end goals and deadlines |
| **Areas**     | Ongoing responsibilities you maintain over time       |
| **Resources** | Topics of interest you want to reference later        |
| **Archives**  | Inactive items from the other three categories        |

## What You'll Create
