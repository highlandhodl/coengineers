## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d18" label="Generate diagrams" />

## What You'll Learn

- Create flowcharts and process diagrams
- Build relationship diagrams
- Generate timelines and sequences
- Use Mermaid syntax effectively

## The Scenario

Fiona wants to explain the whisky-making process to visitors. Old Hamish knows every step but it's all in his head. Time to visualise it.

## Key Concepts

| Concept       | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Flowchart** | Processes with decisions and branches      |
| **Sequence**  | Step-by-step interactions between entities |
| **Timeline**  | Events over time                           |
| **Mindmap**   | Hierarchical ideas from a central concept  |

## What You'll Create

- Valid Mermaid syntax ready to render
- Brief explanation of each diagram
- Suggestions for improvements
- Alternative diagram types if applicable

## Quick Reference

- Start simple - add complexity after it works
- Describe the flow - Claude translates to syntax
- Test rendering - paste into Obsidian or GitHub
- Keep it readable - too many nodes = confusion
