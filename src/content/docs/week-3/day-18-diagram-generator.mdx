## What You'll Learn

- Create flowcharts and process diagrams
- Build relationship diagrams
- Generate timelines and sequences
- Use Mermaid syntax effectively

## The Scenario

Fiona wants to explain the whisky-making process to visitors. Old Hamish knows every step but it's all in his head. Time to visualise it.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d18" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to create clear diagrams from plain text descriptions.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks what you're visualising** - A process, relationships, timeline?
2. **Gets the details** - What are the steps or elements?
3. **Chooses diagram type** - Flowchart, sequence, mindmap, etc.
4. **Specifies the audience** - Technical or general?
5. **Creates Mermaid code** - Ready to render

### Diagram Types

1. **Flowchart** - Processes with decisions
2. **Sequence** - Step-by-step interactions
3. **Timeline** - Events over time
4. **Entity Relationship** - How things connect
5. **Mindmap** - Hierarchical ideas

## Mermaid Syntax Quick Reference

**Flowchart:**
```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Action 1]
    B -->|No| D[Action 2]
```

**Timeline:**
```mermaid
timeline
    title Project Timeline
    2024-01 : Planning
    2024-03 : Development
    2024-06 : Launch
```

**Mindmap:**
```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Central Idea))
    Branch 1
      Leaf 1
      Leaf 2
    Branch 2
```

## Where Mermaid Renders

- Obsidian (built-in)
- VS Code (with extension)
- GitHub markdown
- Many documentation tools

## Example Output

A complete Mermaid diagram with:
- Valid syntax ready to render
- Brief explanation of the diagram
- Suggestions for improvements
- Alternative diagram types if applicable

## Tips for Success

- **Start simple** - Add complexity after it works
- **Describe the flow** - Claude will translate to syntax
- **Test rendering** - Paste into Obsidian or GitHub
- **Keep it readable** - Too many nodes = confusion

## What You Learned

- Text → diagram with Mermaid
- Multiple diagram types for different needs
- Renders in most documentation tools
- No design skills required

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 19: Social Thread Maker](/week-3/day-19-social-thread-maker/), we'll create social media content from long-form notes.
