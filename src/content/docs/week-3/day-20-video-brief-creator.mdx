## What You'll Learn

- Write scripts for AI avatar videos
- Include scene directions and timing
- Create talking head video content
- Prepare for HeyGen generation

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants video content for the website but can't afford a film crew. HeyGen avatars can deliver brand messages. Jamie needs to write the scripts.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d20" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to create production briefs for HeyGen avatar videos.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about the video** - What's it for and where will it live?
2. **Gets key messages** - What must the video communicate?
3. **Understands the tone** - Professional, friendly, energetic?
4. **Specifies length** - 30 seconds, 60 seconds, 2 minutes?
5. **Creates scene-by-scene script** - Ready for HeyGen

### Script Structure for Avatars

```
SCENE 1: [Background description]
[Avatar action: e.g., "smiling, looking at camera"]

DIALOGUE:
"Welcome to Thistle and Thorn..."

[Pause: 1 second]

SCENE 2: [Background description]
...
```

## HeyGen Basics

HeyGen creates talking head videos with:
- AI avatars (or your own)
- Text-to-speech voices
- Scene transitions
- Background changes

## Example Output

A complete video brief with:
- Video overview (title, duration, purpose)
- Avatar and voice recommendations
- Scene-by-scene script
- Background suggestions
- Pause markers and transitions

## HeyGen Tips

1. **Keep scenes short** - Under 30 seconds each
2. **Vary backgrounds** - Keep visual interest
3. **Include pauses** - Natural speech has gaps
4. **Match voice to content** - Professional vs casual
5. **Test with shortest video first** - Iterate quickly

## Tips for Success

- **Write for speaking** - Contractions, natural rhythm
- **Be specific about scenes** - Help yourself in HeyGen
- **Include timing** - Know your target duration
- **Think visually** - What's happening on screen?

## What You Learned

- Avatars need natural speech patterns
- Scene structure keeps videos engaging
- Shorter scenes work better
- Pre-planning saves generation credits

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 21: Video Prompt Master & Week 3 Review](/week-3/day-21-week-3-review/), we'll create cinematic video prompts for Kling and review everything we've built.
