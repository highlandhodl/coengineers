## What You'll Learn

- Write scripts for AI avatar videos
- Include scene directions and timing
- Create talking head video content
- Prepare for HeyGen generation

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants video content for the website but can't afford a film crew. HeyGen avatars can deliver brand messages. Jamie needs to write the scripts.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d20" />

Create production briefs for HeyGen avatar videos.

### What We're Building
Complete video scripts with scene directions, ready for HeyGen avatar generation.

### The Scenario
Thistle & Thorn needs:
- A welcome video for the website
- Product explainer videos
- FAQ responses

No film crew. No expensive production. Just HeyGen.

### HeyGen Basics

HeyGen creates talking head videos with:
- AI avatars (or your own)
- Text-to-speech voices
- Scene transitions
- Background changes

### Script Structure for Avatars

```
SCENE 1: [Background description]
[Avatar action: e.g., "smiling, looking at camera"]

DIALOGUE:
"Welcome to Thistle and Thorn..."

[Pause: 1 second]

SCENE 2: [Background description]
...
```

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Video Brief Creator
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-video-brief.md:

# Create Video Brief

You are helping me create video scripts for HeyGen avatar generation.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Video topic/purpose
- Target length (in seconds/minutes)
- Key messages to convey
- Tone (professional, friendly, energetic)
- Where it will be used

## Your Task
Create a video script with:

1. **Video Overview**
   - Title
   - Duration
   - Purpose
   - Avatar suggestions

2. **Scene-by-Scene Script**
   - Scene number and description
   - Background suggestion
   - Avatar expression/gesture
   - Dialogue (written for speaking)
   - Pause markers
   - Transitions

3. **Technical Notes**
   - Pacing guidance
   - Music suggestions (if any)
   - Text overlays needed

## Output Format
Production-ready script with clear scene breaks.
Dialogue written for natural speech (contractions, pauses).
Keep individual scenes under 30 seconds for best results."

#### Step 2: Create Welcome Video Script
"Create a 90-second welcome video script for Thistle & Thorn's website homepage.

Messages to convey:
- Welcome to our distillery
- Four generations of whisky-making
- We're in the heart of Speyside
- Visit us for tours and tastings
- Sign up for the newsletter for exclusive releases

Tone: Warm, inviting, proud but not boastful
Avatar: Professional woman, 40s, friendly smile

Save to week-3-outputs/welcome-video-brief.md"

#### Step 3: Create Product Video Series
"Create briefs for 3 short (30-second) product videos:

1. The 12-Year Single Malt - our signature whisky
2. The Thistle Gin - seasonal small batch
3. The Distillery Experience - tours and tastings

Each should follow the same format for consistency.
Save to week-3-outputs/product-video-briefs.md"

#### Step 4: FAQ Video Generator
"Create a slash command create-faq-video.md that takes a question and answer and creates a 30-second video script for a friendly FAQ response."

#### Step 5: Prepare for HeyGen
"Add a section to welcome-video-brief.md with:
- HeyGen avatar recommendations
- Voice selections (match Scottish tone if possible)
- Background options
- Export settings for web"

### HeyGen Tips

1. **Keep scenes short** - Under 30 seconds each
2. **Vary backgrounds** - Keep visual interest
3. **Include pauses** - Natural speech has gaps
4. **Match voice to content** - Professional vs casual
5. **Test with shortest video first** - Iterate quickly

### Your Turn
Create a video brief for something you need:
- A welcome/intro video
- A product/service explainer
- An FAQ response

Generate it in HeyGen and see the result.

### What You Learned
- Avatars need natural speech patterns
- Scene structure keeps videos engaging
- Shorter scenes work better
- Pre-planning saves generation credits
