<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w3.d17" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d17" label="Write audio scripts" />

## What You'll Learn

- Write scripts optimised for text-to-speech
- Use SSML tags for pauses and emphasis
- Create natural-sounding audio content
- Prepare scripts for ElevenLabs voices

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants to create audio content: podcast snippets, video voiceovers, and audio guides for distillery tours. ElevenLabs will generate the voice.

## Key Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Writing for Ear** | Shorter sentences, contractions, natural rhythm  |
| **SSML Tags**       | `<break>` for pauses, `<emphasis>` for stress    |
| **Duration Guide**  | 150 words ≈ 1 minute of audio                    |
| **Voice Matching**  | Professional vs casual tone affects voice choice |

## What You'll Create

- Clean scripts for preview (no SSML)
- SSML-formatted scripts for ElevenLabs
- Word count and estimated duration
- Voice recommendations

## Quick Reference

- Write for speaking - read it aloud yourself first
- Include pauses - natural speech has gaps
- Specify target length - know your duration
- Test early - generate a short sample first
