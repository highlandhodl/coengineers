## What You'll Learn

- Write scripts optimised for text-to-speech
- Use SSML tags for pauses and emphasis
- Create natural-sounding audio content
- Prepare scripts for ElevenLabs voices

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants to create audio content: podcast snippets, video voiceovers, and audio guides for distillery tours. ElevenLabs will generate the voice.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d17" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to create voice-ready scripts with SSML markup.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your audio need** - What are you creating?
2. **Gets the content** - What should the script say?
3. **Understands the tone** - Professional, warm, energetic?
4. **Chooses format** - Full SSML or plain script
5. **Creates voice-ready output** - Ready for ElevenLabs

### Writing for Ear vs Eye

**Reading:** "Thistle & Thorn Distillery, est. 1892, produces premium single malt whisky using traditional methods."

**Listening:** "Thistle and Thorn has been making whisky since eighteen ninety-two. Four generations of the MacTavish family, using the same methods their great-grandfather used."

Key differences:
- Shorter sentences
- Write numbers as spoken
- Add pauses for emphasis
- Use contractions (we're, it's)
- Avoid acronyms

## SSML Basics

```xml
<speak>
  Welcome to Thistle and Thorn.
  <break time="0.5s"/>
  We've been making whisky for over a century.
  <emphasis level="strong">Four generations</emphasis>
  of craft and tradition.
</speak>
```

Common tags:
- `<break time="Xs"/>` - Pause for X seconds
- `<emphasis level="strong/moderate">` - Stress words
- `<prosody rate="slow/medium/fast">` - Speaking speed

## Example Output

A complete audio script with:
- Clean version (no SSML, for preview)
- SSML version (for ElevenLabs)
- Word count and estimated duration
- Voice recommendations

## Tips for Success

- **Write for speaking** - Read it aloud yourself first
- **Include pauses** - Natural speech has gaps
- **Specify target length** - 150 words ≈ 1 minute
- **Test early** - Generate a short sample first

## What You Learned

- Writing for ear is different from eye
- Short sentences and pauses matter
- SSML adds natural emphasis
- Iteration improves naturalness

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 18: Diagram Generator](/week-3/day-18-diagram-generator/), we'll build process diagrams with Mermaid.
