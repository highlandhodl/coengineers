## What You'll Learn

- Write scripts optimised for text-to-speech
- Use SSML tags for pauses and emphasis
- Create natural-sounding audio content
- Prepare scripts for ElevenLabs voices

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants to create audio content: podcast snippets, video voiceovers, and audio guides for distillery tours. ElevenLabs will generate the voice.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d17" />

Create scripts optimised for AI voice generation.

### What We're Building
Voice-ready scripts with SSML markup for natural-sounding ElevenLabs audio.

### The Scenario
Thistle & Thorn needs:
- A 60-second brand story for the website
- Distillery tour audio guide snippets
- Podcast intro/outro

Jamie will write the scripts. ElevenLabs will voice them.

### Writing for Ear vs Eye

**Reading:** "Thistle & Thorn Distillery, est. 1892, produces premium single malt whisky using traditional methods."

**Listening:** "Thistle and Thorn has been making whisky since eighteen ninety-two. Four generations of the MacTavish family, using the same methods their great-grandfather used."

Key differences:
- Shorter sentences
- Write numbers as spoken
- Add pauses for emphasis
- Use contractions (we're, it's)
- Avoid acronyms

### SSML Basics

```xml
<speak>
  Welcome to Thistle and Thorn.
  <break time="0.5s"/>
  We've been making whisky for over a century.
  <emphasis level="strong">Four generations</emphasis>
  of craft and tradition.
</speak>
```

Common tags:
- `<break time="Xs"/>` - Pause for X seconds
- `<emphasis level="strong/moderate">` - Stress words
- `<prosody rate="slow/medium/fast">` - Speaking speed

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Audio Script Writer
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/write-audio-script.md:

# Write Audio Script

You are helping me write scripts for text-to-speech generation (ElevenLabs, etc.).

## Input
I'll provide:
- The content or topic
- Target length (in seconds or words)
- Tone (professional, warm, energetic, etc.)
- Where it will be used (website, podcast, tour, etc.)

## Your Task
Create a voice-optimised script with:

1. **Natural language** - Write for listening, not reading
2. **Appropriate pacing** - Short sentences, natural pauses
3. **SSML markup** - Breaks, emphasis where helpful
4. **Pronunciation guides** - For unusual words

## Output Format
Provide:
- Clean script (no SSML, for preview)
- SSML version (for ElevenLabs)
- Word count and estimated duration (150 words ≈ 1 minute)
- Voice recommendations (warm, authoritative, etc.)

Use British English. Natural and conversational."

#### Step 2: Create the Brand Story Script
"Write a 60-second audio script for Thistle & Thorn's website homepage.

Content to cover:
- Fourth generation family distillery
- Speyside location
- Traditional methods
- Premium single malt and seasonal gin
- Visitor experiences available

Tone: Warm, proud, inviting
Voice: Soft Scottish accent (suggest ElevenLabs voice)

Save to week-3-outputs/brand-story-audio.md"

#### Step 3: Create Tour Guide Snippets
"Write 3 short (20-second each) audio snippets for a distillery tour:

1. Welcome to the Visitor Centre
2. Entering the Cask Warehouse
3. The Tasting Room

Each should be standalone. Include SSML for dramatic pauses.
Save to week-3-outputs/tour-audio-snippets.md"

#### Step 4: Test in ElevenLabs
1. Go to elevenlabs.io
2. Paste your SSML script
3. Select a voice (try "Charlie" for warm British)
4. Generate and listen
5. Iterate on script as needed

#### Step 5: Create a Quick Version
"Create write-audio-quick.md that takes any text and converts it to a spoken-word script with appropriate pauses. No SSML, just natural language."

### Pronunciation Guide for Thistle & Thorn

| Word | Pronunciation |
|------|---------------|
| Speyside | SPAY-side |
| Whisky | WISS-key (not whis-KEY) |
| MacTavish | Mac-TAV-ish |
| Cask | Cahsk (soft 'a') |

### Your Turn
Write an audio script for something you need:
- A welcome message
- An explainer video voiceover
- A podcast intro

Generate it in ElevenLabs and iterate.

### What You Learned
- Writing for ear is different from eye
- Short sentences and pauses matter
- SSML adds natural emphasis
- Iteration improves naturalness

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/write-audio-script.md`
- `.claude/commands/write-audio-quick.md`
- `brand-story-audio.md` with clean and SSML versions
- `tour-audio-snippets.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 18: Diagram Generator](/week-3/day-18-diagram-generator/), we'll build process diagrams with Mermaid.
