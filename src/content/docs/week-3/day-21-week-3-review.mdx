## What You'll Learn

- Create cinematic video prompts for Kling
- Review and consolidate Week 3 skills
- Build a creative outputs toolkit
- Prepare for Week 4

## The Scenario

Jamie wants cinematic B-roll footage: whisky being poured, flames in the kiln, casks in the warehouse. Kling can generate these. Plus, time to review everything we've built.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d21" />

Create cinematic video prompts and consolidate your creative toolkit.

## Part 1: Kling Video Prompts

### What We're Building
Prompts for AI video generation that create cinematic B-roll and atmospheric footage.

### The Scenario
Thistle & Thorn needs B-roll for their brand video:
- Whisky being poured in slow motion
- Flames dancing in the kiln
- Light streaming through the warehouse
- Hands checking cask quality

### Video Prompt Anatomy

```
[Subject] + [Action] + [Camera Movement] + [Style] + [Lighting] + [Duration]

Example:
"Amber whisky being poured into a crystal glass, slow motion,
close-up tracking shot following the liquid, cinematic style,
warm golden backlighting, 4 seconds"
```

### Step 1: Create Video Prompt Generator
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-video-prompt.md:

# Create Video Prompt

You are helping me write prompts for AI video generation (Kling, etc.)

## Input
I'll describe:
- What I want to see
- The mood/feeling
- How it will be used

## Your Task
Create a video prompt including:

1. **Subject** - What's in frame
2. **Action** - What's happening
3. **Camera** - Movement and angle
4. **Style** - Cinematic, documentary, etc.
5. **Lighting** - Type and mood
6. **Duration** - 2-4 seconds typically

## Camera Movement Options
- Static: Fixed camera
- Pan: Horizontal movement
- Tilt: Vertical movement
- Tracking: Following subject
- Dolly: Moving towards/away
- Aerial/drone: High angle moving

## Output Format
Provide:
- Main prompt (ready for Kling)
- 2 variations with different approaches
- Duration recommendation
- Any post-processing suggestions"

### Step 2: Create Thistle & Thorn B-Roll Prompts
"Create 5 cinematic video prompts for Thistle & Thorn:

1. Whisky pour - Glamour shot of liquid gold
2. Kiln flames - Dancing fire, atmospheric
3. Cask warehouse - Light beams, scale, heritage
4. Hands on cask - Craftsmanship, human touch
5. Steam from still - Magical, process in action

Each should feel premium, cinematic, brand-worthy.

## Part 2: Week 3 Review

### What You Built This Week

| Day | Tool | What You Created |
|-----|------|------------------|
| 15 | Gamma | Presentation outlines |
| 16 | Gemini | Image generation prompts |
| 17 | ElevenLabs | Audio scripts with SSML |
| 18 | Mermaid | Process diagrams |
| 19 | Social | Multi-platform content |
| 20 | HeyGen | Avatar video scripts |
| 21 | Kling | Cinematic video prompts |

### Step 3: Audit Your Creative Commands
"List all slash commands I created during Week 3. For each:
- Show the file path
- One-line description
- Which tool it works with"

### Step 4: Create Week 3 Retrospective
"Create a retrospective at 01-projects/learning-claude-code/week-3-retro.md with:
- Frontmatter: date, week: 3
- Creative outputs I generated
- Which command I'll use most
- Tools I need to sign up for
- Ideas for using these in my work"

### Step 5: Build a Creative Brief Router
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-asset.md that asks what type of creative asset I need, then routes to the appropriate creator:
- Presentation → build-presentation
- Image → create-image-prompt
- Audio → write-audio-script
- Diagram → create-diagram
- Social → create-social
- Video (talking head) → create-video-brief
- Video (cinematic) → create-video-prompt"

### Step 6: Preview Week 4
Week 4 is about business assets - documents that drive revenue.

"Look at my notes and processed content. Suggest 3 things I could create in Week 4:
- Blog posts
- Newsletters
- Proposals
- Case studies
- Reports"

### The Creative Outputs Pipeline

```
