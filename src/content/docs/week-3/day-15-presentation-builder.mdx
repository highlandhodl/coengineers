## What You'll Learn

- Transform notes into presentation structures
- Understand Gamma's import format
- Create compelling slide narratives
- Design for impact, not information overload

## The Scenario

Fiona has a meeting with a potential Edinburgh distributor. She has notes from previous conversations but no deck. Jamie needs to create a compelling presentation.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d15" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to transform your notes into presentation-ready outlines.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your presentation** - What's it for and who's the audience?
2. **Understands your content** - What notes or material do you have?
3. **Gets your goal** - What do you want the audience to do?
4. **Chooses structure** - Full deck, quick pitch, or custom length
5. **Creates Gamma-ready output** - Clean markdown for import

### Presentation Principles

1. **One idea per slide** - Don't cram
2. **Headlines that stand alone** - Each slide title tells the story
3. **Start with why** - Problem before solution
4. **End with action** - What do you want them to do?

## Gamma Import Format

Gamma works best with:
- Clear hierarchy (# for slide titles)
- Bullet points for key messages
- Simple markdown formatting

## Example Output

A clean markdown file with:
- Title slide with compelling headline
- Problem/opportunity framing
- Content slides (one idea each)
- Supporting bullets and visual suggestions
- Strong call to action

## Importing to Gamma

1. Go to gamma.app
2. Click "Create New" → "Import"
3. Paste your markdown outline
4. Gamma generates designed slides
5. Customise colours/fonts as needed

## Tips for Success

- **Share your actual notes** - The more context, the better
- **Be clear about the audience** - Affects tone and depth
- **Specify the call to action** - Every presentation should drive action
- **Less is more** - Fight the urge to add slides

## What You Learned

- Notes → outline → designed deck
- One idea per slide
- Headlines should tell the story alone
- Gamma does the design work

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 16: Image Prompter](/week-3/day-16-image-prompter/), we'll generate detailed AI image prompts for Gemini.
