## What You'll Learn

- Transform notes into presentation structures
- Understand Gamma's import format
- Create compelling slide narratives
- Design for impact, not information overload

## The Scenario

Fiona has a meeting with a potential Edinburgh distributor. She has notes from previous conversations but no deck. Jamie needs to create a compelling presentation.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d15" />

Transform your notes into presentation-ready outlines.

### What We're Building
A Gamma-ready presentation outline from your notes, with compelling structure and clear messaging.

### The Scenario
Fiona needs a deck for Edinburgh Spirits Distributors. She has:
- Notes from a discovery call
- Key points about Thistle & Thorn
- Pricing information

Jamie needs to create a 10-slide deck. No design skills needed.

### Presentation Principles

1. **One idea per slide** - Don't cram
2. **Headlines that stand alone** - Each slide title tells the story
3. **Start with why** - Problem before solution
4. **End with action** - What do you want them to do?

### Gamma Import Format

Gamma works best with:
- Clear hierarchy (# for slide titles)
- Bullet points for key messages
- Simple markdown formatting

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Presentation Builder
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/build-presentation.md:

# Build Presentation Outline

You are helping me create a presentation outline ready for Gamma import.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Topic or purpose of the presentation
- Any source notes or content
- Target audience
- Desired length (number of slides)

## Your Task
Create a presentation outline with:

1. **Title Slide**
   - Compelling headline
   - Subtitle with context

2. **Problem/Opportunity Slide**
   - Why this matters to the audience

3. **Content Slides** (as many as needed)
   - One key message per slide
   - 3-4 supporting bullet points
   - Suggestion for visual if applicable

4. **Call to Action Slide**
   - Clear next step
   - Contact information

## Output Format
Markdown with # for slide titles, ## for slide subtitles, and - for bullet points. Add [VISUAL: description] notes for images/charts.

Keep it punchy. Less text = better slides."

#### Step 2: Build the Distributor Deck
"Using my presentation builder, create a 10-slide deck for Thistle & Thorn's meeting with Edinburgh Spirits Distributors.

Context:
- Thistle & Thorn is a craft whisky distillery in Speyside
- 4th generation family owned
- Products: Single malt (12yr, 18yr), seasonal gin
- Looking for Edinburgh distribution partner
- Key selling points: authenticity, craft quality, growing demand

Audience: Distribution manager, interested in premium spirits
Goal: Get them to agree to a trial order

Save to week-3-outputs/edinburgh-distributor-deck.md"

#### Step 3: Review and Refine
"Review the deck outline. For each slide:
- Is the headline compelling enough to stand alone?
- Are there too many bullets?
- Suggest one improvement per slide"

#### Step 4: Create a Quick Version
"Create a slash command build-presentation-quick.md that creates a 5-slide deck outline: Title, Problem, Solution, Proof, Action. Ultra-concise."

#### Step 5: Export for Gamma
"Format the deck outline for direct Gamma import. Remove any notes or comments. Clean markdown only."

### Importing to Gamma

1. Go to gamma.app
2. Click "Create New" → "Import"
3. Paste your markdown outline
4. Gamma generates designed slides
5. Customise colours/fonts as needed

### Sample Notes to Practice

Here are Jamie's notes for the distributor meeting:

---
Edinburgh Spirits call - key points:
- They're looking for premium Scottish spirits
- Current gap: authentic craft whisky (not industrial)
- Their buyers want a story
- Trial order minimum: 50 cases
- 30% margin expected
- They handle all Edinburgh bars and restaurants
- Growing demand for local/authentic
- They liked our Instagram content
- Fiona could do a tasting event for their buyers
---

### Your Turn
Take notes from a real presentation you need to create. Run them through the presentation builder. Import to Gamma.

### What You Learned
- Notes → outline → designed deck
- One idea per slide
- Headlines should tell the story alone
- Gamma does the design work

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/build-presentation.md`
- `.claude/commands/build-presentation-quick.md`
