## What You'll Learn

- Transform notes into presentation structures
- Understand Gamma's import format
- Create compelling slide narratives
- Design for impact, not information overload

## The Scenario

Fiona has a meeting with a potential Edinburgh distributor. She has notes from previous conversations but no deck. Time to create a compelling presentation.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                        | Description                                     |
| ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **One Idea Per Slide**         | Don't cram - each slide communicates one thing  |
| **Headlines That Stand Alone** | Slide titles should tell the story              |
| **Start with Why**             | Problem before solution                         |
| **End with Action**            | Every presentation needs a clear call to action |

## What You'll Create

- Presentation outlines ready for Gamma import
- Clear slide narratives with compelling headlines
- Visual suggestions for each slide
- Strong calls to action

## Quick Reference

- Share actual notes - more context means better output
- Be clear about your audience - affects tone and depth
- Specify the call to action - drive action, not just information
- Less is more - fight the urge to add slides
