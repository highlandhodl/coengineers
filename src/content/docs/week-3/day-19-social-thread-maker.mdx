import SlashCommand from '../../../components/SlashCommand.astro';
import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w3.d19" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d19" label="Create social content" />

## What You'll Learn

- Break long-form content into social posts
- Write platform-specific content (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Create hooks that stop the scroll
- Build content series and threads

## The Scenario

Jamie has blog posts, notes, and ideas but no social media content. Every platform is different. Time to create a content engine.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                       | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Platform Differences**      | Twitter: 280 chars, punchy. LinkedIn: longer, professional |
| **Hook Formulas**             | Contrarian, Numbers, Story, Question, Challenge            |
| **One Idea = Multiple Posts** | Repurpose ruthlessly across platforms                      |
| **Call to Action**            | Every post should drive action                             |

## What You'll Create

- Platform-specific posts with strong hooks
- Body content optimised for each platform
- Calls to action for engagement
- Hashtag suggestions where appropriate

## Quick Reference

- Lead with the hook - first line is everything
- One idea = multiple posts - repurpose ruthlessly
- Know platform norms - LinkedIn ≠ Twitter
- Include a CTA - what should readers do next?
