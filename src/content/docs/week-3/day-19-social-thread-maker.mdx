## What You'll Learn

- Break long-form content into social posts
- Write platform-specific content (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Create hooks that stop the scroll
- Build content series and threads

## The Scenario

Jamie has blog posts, notes, and ideas but no social media content. Every platform is different. Time to create a content engine.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d19" />

Transform long-form content into engaging social media posts.

### What We're Building
Social media content for multiple platforms from your existing notes and content.

### The Scenario
Jamie wrote a blog post about "Why Craft Whisky Beats Mass Market." Now they need:
- A Twitter/X thread
- LinkedIn posts
- Instagram captions

One piece of content, multiple platforms.

### Platform Differences

**Twitter/X:**
- 280 characters
- Threads for longer content
- Hooks are everything
- Casual, punchy tone

**LinkedIn:**
- Longer posts OK (3000 chars)
- More professional tone
- Stories perform well
- Line breaks for readability

**Instagram:**
- Image-first
- Captions up to 2200 chars
- Hashtags matter
- More emotional/visual language

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Social Content Generator
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-social.md:

# Create Social Media Content

You are helping me turn content into social media posts.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Source content (notes, blog post, idea)
- Target platform(s)
- Tone preference
- Call to action (if any)

## Your Task
Create platform-specific content:

**For Twitter/X:**
- Hook tweet (stops the scroll)
- Thread if content is substantial (numbered)
- Each tweet under 280 chars
- End with CTA

**For LinkedIn:**
- Hook (first line visible before 'see more')
- Story structure or key points
- Professional but human tone
- CTA in final paragraph

**For Instagram:**
- Caption with hook
- Emoji usage (moderate)
- Hashtag suggestions (10-15)
- CTA

## Hook Formulas That Work
- Contrarian: 'Unpopular opinion: [thing]'
- Numbers: '5 things I learnt about [X]'
- Story: 'I used to think [X]. Then [Y] happened.'
- Question: 'Why do most [X] fail at [Y]?'

## Output Format
Separate sections for each platform. Ready to copy and paste."

#### Step 2: Create Thistle & Thorn Social Content
"Create social content from this blog post outline:

Title: Why Craft Whisky Beats Mass Market (Every Time)

Key points:
- Mass market whisky is blended for consistency, not character
- Craft distilleries use local ingredients, unique water sources
- You can taste the place in craft whisky
- Small batches mean the distiller knows every cask
- The story matters - who made this, why, how
- Craft whisky supports local economy and traditions
- Price reflects care, not just marketing

Create:
1. Twitter/X thread (7 tweets)
2. LinkedIn post
3. Instagram caption

Save to week-3-outputs/craft-whisky-social.md"

#### Step 3: Create a Hook Generator
"Create a slash command create-hooks.md that takes a topic and generates 10 different hooks using different formulas (contrarian, numbers, story, question, etc.)."

#### Step 4: Content Calendar Helper
"Create a slash command plan-social-week.md that takes a topic or content piece and suggests 5 different posts for the week, each with a different angle."

#### Step 5: Carousel Outline
"Create a 10-slide Instagram carousel outline from the craft whisky content. Each slide should have a headline and 1-2 bullet points. First slide is the hook."

### Hook Formulas

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "Expensive whisky is often worse than £30 bottles" |
| Numbers | "3 things every whisky label is hiding from you" |
| Story | "My grandfather's distillery almost closed. Here's what saved it." |
| Question | "Why do Japanese whiskies win so many awards?" |
| Challenge | "Stop buying whisky based on age. Here's what actually matters." |
| Behind the scenes | "This is what happens in a cask for 12 years" |

### Your Turn
Take a piece of content you've created and run it through the social content generator. Create posts for at least 2 platforms.

### What You Learned
- One idea = multiple platform posts
- Hooks are the most important element
- Each platform has different norms
- Repurposing beats creating from scratch

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/create-social.md`
- `.claude/commands/create-hooks.md`
- `.claude/commands/plan-social-week.md`
- `craft-whisky-social.md` with multi-platform content

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 20: Video Brief Creator](/week-3/day-20-video-brief-creator/), we'll write scripts for HeyGen avatar videos.
