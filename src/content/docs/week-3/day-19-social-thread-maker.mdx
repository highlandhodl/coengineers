## What You'll Learn

- Break long-form content into social posts
- Write platform-specific content (Twitter/X, LinkedIn)
- Create hooks that stop the scroll
- Build content series and threads

## The Scenario

Jamie has blog posts, notes, and ideas but no social media content. Every platform is different. Time to create a content engine.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d19" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to transform long-form content into engaging social media posts.

### What the Command Does

1. **Gets your source content** - Blog post, notes, or idea
2. **Asks which platforms** - Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram?
3. **Understands the goal** - Awareness, engagement, traffic?
4. **Gets your voice** - Professional, casual, provocative?
5. **Creates platform-specific posts** - Ready to copy and paste

### Platform Differences

**Twitter/X:**
- 280 characters
- Threads for longer content
- Hooks are everything
- Casual, punchy tone

**LinkedIn:**
- Longer posts OK (3000 chars)
- More professional tone
- Stories perform well
- Line breaks for readability

**Instagram:**
- Image-first
- Captions up to 2200 chars
- Hashtags matter
- More emotional/visual language

## Hook Formulas That Work

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "Expensive whisky is often worse than £30 bottles" |
| Numbers | "3 things every whisky label is hiding from you" |
| Story | "My grandfather's distillery almost closed. Here's what saved it." |
| Question | "Why do Japanese whiskies win so many awards?" |
| Challenge | "Stop buying whisky based on age. Here's what actually matters." |
| Behind the scenes | "This is what happens in a cask for 12 years" |

## Example Output

Platform-specific content with:
- Hook that stops the scroll
- Body content optimised for platform
- Call to action
- Hashtag suggestions (where appropriate)

## Tips for Success

- **Lead with the hook** - First line is everything
- **One idea = multiple posts** - Repurpose ruthlessly
- **Know the platform norms** - LinkedIn ≠ Twitter
- **Include a CTA** - What should readers do next?

## What You Learned

- One idea = multiple platform posts
- Hooks are the most important element
- Each platform has different norms
- Repurposing beats creating from scratch

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 20: Video Brief Creator](/week-3/day-20-video-brief-creator/), we'll write scripts for HeyGen avatar videos.
