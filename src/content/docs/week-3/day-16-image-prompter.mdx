## What You'll Learn

- Write detailed prompts for AI image generation
- Understand style, composition, and lighting descriptions
- Create consistent visual styles across multiple images
- Use Gemini (Google AI Studio) effectively

## The Scenario

Jamie needs images for the Christmas campaign: product shots, lifestyle images, and social media graphics. Photographer is too expensive. AI generation is the answer.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d16" />

Create detailed prompts for AI image generation.

### What We're Building
A set of detailed image prompts for Gemini that produce consistent, professional-looking images.

### The Scenario
Jamie needs 5 images for the Christmas campaign:
1. Hero product shot of the 12-year whisky
2. Lifestyle shot: whisky by a fireplace
3. Behind-the-scenes: cask warehouse
4. Christmas theme: gift packaging
5. Social media: quote graphic background

### Anatomy of a Good Prompt

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Mood] + [Technical]

Example:
"A bottle of single malt whisky on a rustic oak table,
product photography style, centred composition with
shallow depth of field, warm golden hour lighting from
the left, cosy and inviting mood, 4K, photorealistic"
```

### Style Consistency

For a coherent campaign, define:
- **Colour palette:** Warm ambers, deep browns, cream whites
- **Lighting style:** Warm, natural, golden
- **Photography style:** Lifestyle/editorial, not clinical
- **Mood:** Cosy, authentic, premium

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Image Prompter
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-image-prompt.md:

# Create Image Prompt

You are helping me write detailed prompts for AI image generation (Gemini, DALL-E, Midjourney).

## Input
I'll describe:
- What I want in the image
- The intended use (social media, website, print)
- Any style preferences

## Your Task
Create a detailed prompt including:

1. **Subject** - What's in the image
2. **Style** - Photography/illustration style
3. **Composition** - How elements are arranged
4. **Lighting** - Type, direction, quality
5. **Colours** - Palette and tones
6. **Mood** - Emotional feeling
7. **Technical** - Quality descriptors (4K, photorealistic, etc.)

## Output Format
Provide:
- The full prompt (ready to paste into Gemini)
- 2-3 variations with different approaches
- Negative prompt (what to avoid)

Keep prompts under 100 words each."

#### Step 2: Create the Campaign Images
"Create image prompts for Thistle & Thorn's Christmas campaign:

1. Hero product shot: 12-year single malt whisky bottle
   - Premium feel, gift-worthy
   - For website hero banner

2. Lifestyle: Whisky being enjoyed by a fireplace
   - Cosy, inviting, winter evening
   - For Instagram

3. Behind-the-scenes: The cask warehouse
   - Authentic, heritage feel
   - For brand storytelling

4. Christmas: Gift box with whisky and glasses
   - Festive but elegant
   - For promotional materials

5. Quote background: Abstract warm texture
   - For overlaying text
   - Instagram quotes

Create all 5 prompts with consistent style.
Save to week-3-outputs/christmas-campaign-prompts.md"

#### Step 3: Create Style Guide Prompt
"Create a 'style guide' section at the top of the prompts file that defines the consistent elements across all images. Someone should be able to use this to create new images in the same style."

#### Step 4: Test in Gemini
Take one prompt and run it in Google AI Studio:

1. Go to aistudio.google.com
2. Select Gemini with image generation
3. Paste your prompt
4. Generate and iterate

#### Step 5: Iteration Prompt
"Create a slash command improve-image-prompt.md that takes a prompt and an issue (e.g., 'too dark', 'wrong style') and improves the prompt to fix it."

### Prompt Patterns That Work

**For products:**
"Product photography of [item], [surface/background], studio lighting, [brand mood], commercial quality, 4K"

**For lifestyle:**
"[Person/scene] with [product], [location], natural lighting, [mood], editorial photography style, shallow depth of field"

**For textures/backgrounds:**
"Abstract [texture type], [colour palette], soft gradients, suitable for text overlay, [mood], high resolution"

### Your Turn
Create 3 image prompts for something you actually need:
- A product you're selling
- A blog post header
- A social media graphic

Generate them in Gemini and iterate.

### What You Learned
- Detailed prompts = better images
- Consistency comes from defined style elements
- Iteration is normal and expected
- Structure: subject + style + composition + lighting + mood

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/create-image-prompt.md`
- `.claude/commands/improve-image-prompt.md`
- `christmas-campaign-prompts.md` with 5 prompts + style guide

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 17: Audio Script Writer](/week-3/day-17-audio-script-writer/), we'll create scripts for ElevenLabs voice synthesis.
