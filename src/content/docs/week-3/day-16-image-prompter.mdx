## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d16" label="Create image prompts" />

## What You'll Learn

- Write detailed prompts for AI image generation
- Understand style, composition, and lighting descriptions
- Create consistent visual styles across multiple images
- Use Gemini (Google AI Studio) effectively

## The Scenario

Jamie needs images for the Christmas campaign: product shots, lifestyle images, and social media graphics. Photographer is too expensive. AI generation is the answer.

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt Anatomy**    | Subject + Style + Composition + Lighting + Mood + Technical      |
| **Style Consistency** | Define colour palette, lighting, and mood for coherent campaigns |
| **Negative Prompts**  | Specify what to avoid for better results                         |
| **Iteration**         | First output is rarely perfect - refine in Gemini                |

## What You'll Create

- Detailed image prompts ready for Gemini
- 2-3 variations with different approaches
- Negative prompts for quality control
- Style guide for consistency across images

## Quick Reference

- Be specific about mood - "warm" beats "nice"
- Include technical details - 4K, photorealistic, shallow DOF
- Create a style guide - keeps multiple images consistent
- Iterate in Gemini - refinement is expected
