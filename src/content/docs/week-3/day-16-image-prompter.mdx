## What You'll Learn

- Write detailed prompts for AI image generation
- Understand style, composition, and lighting descriptions
- Create consistent visual styles across multiple images
- Use Gemini (Google AI Studio) effectively

## The Scenario

Jamie needs images for the Christmas campaign: product shots, lifestyle images, and social media graphics. Photographer is too expensive. AI generation is the answer.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w3.d16" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to create detailed prompts for AI image generation.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks what you need** - What image are you trying to create?
2. **Understands the use** - Website, social, print, etc.
3. **Gets style preferences** - Photography, illustration, mood
4. **Defines consistency** - Brand colours and visual language
5. **Creates detailed prompts** - Ready to paste into Gemini

### Anatomy of a Good Prompt

```
[Subject] + [Style] + [Composition] + [Lighting] + [Mood] + [Technical]

Example:
"A bottle of single malt whisky on a rustic oak table,
product photography style, centred composition with
shallow depth of field, warm golden hour lighting from
the left, cosy and inviting mood, 4K, photorealistic"
```

## Style Consistency

For a coherent campaign, define:
- **Colour palette:** Warm ambers, deep browns, cream whites
- **Lighting style:** Warm, natural, golden
- **Photography style:** Lifestyle/editorial, not clinical
- **Mood:** Cosy, authentic, premium

## Example Output

A complete prompt set with:
- Main prompt ready for Gemini
- 2-3 variations with different approaches
- Negative prompt (what to avoid)
- Style guide for consistency across images

## Prompt Patterns That Work

**For products:**
"Product photography of [item], [surface/background], studio lighting, [brand mood], commercial quality, 4K"

**For lifestyle:**
"[Person/scene] with [product], [location], natural lighting, [mood], editorial photography style, shallow depth of field"

**For textures/backgrounds:**
"Abstract [texture type], [colour palette], soft gradients, suitable for text overlay, [mood], high resolution"

## Tips for Success

- **Be specific about mood** - "Warm" is better than "nice"
- **Include technical details** - 4K, photorealistic, shallow DOF
- **Create a style guide** - Keeps multiple images consistent
- **Iterate in Gemini** - First output is rarely perfect

## What You Learned

- Detailed prompts = better images
- Consistency comes from defined style elements
- Iteration is normal and expected
- Structure: subject + style + composition + lighting + mood

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 17: Audio Script Writer](/week-3/day-17-audio-script-writer/), we'll create scripts for ElevenLabs voice synthesis.
