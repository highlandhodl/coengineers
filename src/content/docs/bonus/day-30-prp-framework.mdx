## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/bonus.d30" label="Build with PRP" />

## What You'll Learn

- Understand Prompt-Response-Product pattern
- Structure complex builds with PRP
- Execute the core project build
- Create reusable project patterns

## The Scenario

Day 30 is build day. You've got your BMAD plan from yesterday. Now it's time to execute using PRP - a pattern for AI-assisted creation that ensures quality at every step.

## Key Concepts

| Concept       | Description                                                     |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt**    | Detailed request with context, task, format, constraints        |
| **Response**  | What the AI produces - review what's good, note what needs work |
| **Product**   | Refined, shipped output after editing and polishing             |
| **Iteration** | Better to refine than restart                                   |

## What You'll Create

- Core project components using PRP cycles
- Progress tracking for each piece
- Preparation for ship day
- Momentum for final push

## Quick Reference

- Don't skip the prompt - detailed context = better output
- Review critically - AI output is a draft, not final
- Iterate quickly - refinement is where quality happens
- Keep shipping in mind - must-have vs nice-to-have
