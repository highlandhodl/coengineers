## What You'll Learn

- Understand Prompt-Response-Product pattern
- Structure complex builds with PRP
- Execute the core project build
- Create reusable project patterns

## What is PRP?

PRP = Prompt-Response-Product

A pattern for AI-assisted creation:

1. **Prompt** - The detailed request
2. **Response** - What the AI produces
3. **Product** - The refined, shipped output

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/bonus.d30" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to execute your Day 30 build using PRP.

### What the Command Does

1. **Reviews yesterday's progress** - What got done on Day 29?
2. **Lists today's tasks** - What's the Day 30 focus?
3. **Structures each component** - Using PRP for quality
4. **Tracks completion** - What's done, what's left?
5. **Prepares for Ship Day** - What must happen tomorrow?

## PRP in Action

For each piece of your project:

### 1. Prompt - Write a detailed request
- **Context:** What exists already
- **Task:** What you need created
- **Format:** How it should look
- **Constraints:** Any limitations

### 2. Response - Get the AI output
- Review what's produced
- Note what's good
- Note what needs work

### 3. Product - Refine to final form
- Edit and improve
- Ensure consistency
- Polish for shipping

## Example PRP Cycle

**Prompt:**
```
Create a homepage for my personal website. Context: I'm a
marketing consultant. Task: Write hero section copy, about
section, and services list. Format: Markdown ready for Astro.
Constraints: British English, warm but professional tone.
```

**Response:**
[AI generates content]

**Product:**
[You review, edit, refine, and finalise]

## Day 30 Focus

Today is about building the core:
- Execute your BMAD plan's Day 30 tasks
- Use PRP for each major component
- Track what's complete vs in-progress
- Prepare for tomorrow's ship day

## Tips for Success

- **Don't skip the prompt** - Detailed context = better output
- **Review critically** - AI output is a draft, not final
- **Iterate quickly** - Better to refine than restart
- **Keep shipping in mind** - What must be done vs nice-to-have?

## What You Learned

- PRP structures AI-assisted creation
- Detailed prompts get better responses
- Refinement is where quality happens
- Build day requires focus and momentum

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 31: Ship It!](/bonus/day-31-ship-it/), we'll polish and launch your Capstone project.
