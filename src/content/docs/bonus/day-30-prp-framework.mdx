## What You'll Learn

- Understand Prompt-Response-Product pattern
- Structure complex builds with PRP
- Execute the core project build
- Create reusable project patterns

## What is PRP?

PRP = Prompt-Response-Product

A pattern for AI-assisted creation:

1. **Prompt** - The detailed request
2. **Response** - What the AI produces
3. **Product** - The refined, shipped output

## What We're Building

The core of your Capstone project, structured with Prompt-Response-Product methodology.

## PRP Framework

For each piece of your project:

### 1. Prompt - Write a detailed request
- Context: What exists already
- Task: What you need created
- Format: How it should look
- Constraints: Any limitations

### 2. Response - Get the AI output
- Review what's produced
- Note what's good
- Note what needs work

### 3. Product - Refine to final form
- Edit and improve
- Ensure consistency
- Polish for shipping

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Review Yesterday's Progress

<SlashCommand command="/bonus.d30" />

```
Review my BMAD plan and Day 29 work. What's the status?
What should I focus on today?
```

### Step 2: List Today's Build Tasks

```
From my BMAD plan, extract the Day 30 tasks. List them
in order of priority with estimated time for each.
```

### Step 3: Execute with PRP

For each major component, use PRP:

```
I need to build [COMPONENT]. Using PRP:

**Context:** [What exists]
**Task:** [What to create]
**Format:** [How it should look]
**Constraints:** [Limitations]

Create this component.
```

### Step 4: Review and Refine

```
Review what we've built today:
- What's complete?
- What needs refinement?
- What's ready for Day 31 polish?
```

### Step 5: Prepare for Ship Day

```
What needs to happen tomorrow to ship this project?
Create a Day 31 checklist.
```

## PRP in Action

Example PRP cycle:

**Prompt:**
```
Create a homepage for my personal website. Context: I'm a
marketing consultant. Task: Write hero section copy, about
section, and services list. Format: Markdown ready for Astro.
Constraints: British English, warm but professional tone.
```

**Response:**
[AI generates content]

**Product:**
[You review, edit, refine, and finalise]

## Your Turn

Execute your Day 30 tasks using PRP for each component. Build the core of your project.

## What's Next?

Day 31: Ship It! - Polish and launch. Run `/bonus.d31` when you're ready!
