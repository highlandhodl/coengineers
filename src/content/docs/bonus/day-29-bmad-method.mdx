## What You'll Learn

- Understand the BMAD framework
- Create a project brief using BMAD
- Define breakthrough goals
- Plan with AI-assisted methodology

## The Capstone Project

You've learned 28 days of skills. Now it's time to build something real.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/bonus.d29" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to plan your Capstone project using the BMAD framework.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your project ideas** - What do you want to build?
2. **Evaluates feasibility** - Can you ship it in 3 days?
3. **Defines your breakthrough goal** - What's the big outcome?
4. **Creates the BMAD plan** - Method, Agents, Deliverables
5. **Plans Day 29 work** - What to complete today

## BMAD Framework

BMAD = Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development

A framework for using AI to plan and execute complex projects:

1. **Breakthrough Goal** - What's the big outcome?
2. **Method** - How will we achieve it?
3. **Agents** - What AI agents/tools help?
4. **Deliverables** - What will we produce?

## Choose a Capstone Project

Pick something that:
1. Uses skills from multiple weeks
2. Is genuinely useful to you
3. Can be completed in 3 days

Examples:
- A personal website with blog
- A documentation site for a project
- A content automation pipeline
- Your own slash command library
- A chatbot for your business

## Example BMAD Plan

**Breakthrough Goal:** Launch a personal website that showcases my work and generates leads.

**Method:**
- Day 29: Plan and scaffold
- Day 30: Build core pages
- Day 31: Polish and ship

**Agents:** Claude Code, Gamma for design, Vercel for hosting

**Deliverables:**
- Live website
- Content pages
- Contact form
- README documentation

## Tips for Success

- **Be realistic** - 3 days goes fast
- **Use your new skills** - That's the point
- **Ship something** - Done beats perfect
- **Document as you go** - Future you will thank you

## What You Learned

- BMAD structures AI-assisted projects
- Breakthrough goals keep you focused
- Planning prevents thrashing
- 3 days is enough to ship something real

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 30: PRP Framework](/bonus/day-30-prp-framework/), we'll structure the build using Prompt-Response-Product.
