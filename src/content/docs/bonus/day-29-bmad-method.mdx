## What You'll Learn

- Understand the BMAD framework
- Create a project brief using BMAD
- Define breakthrough goals
- Plan with AI-assisted methodology

## BMAD Framework

BMAD = Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development

A framework for using AI to plan and execute complex projects:

1. **Breakthrough Goal** - What's the big outcome?
2. **Method** - How will we achieve it?
3. **Agents** - What AI agents/tools help?
4. **Deliverables** - What will we produce?

## What We're Building

A complete project plan using the Breakthrough Method for Agile AI-Driven Development.

## The Capstone Project

You've learned 28 days of skills. Now it's time to build something real.

Choose a project that:
1. Uses skills from multiple weeks
2. Is genuinely useful to you
3. Can be completed in 3 days

Examples:
- A personal website with blog
- A documentation site for a project
- A content automation pipeline
- Your own slash command library
- A chatbot for your business

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Choose Your Project

<SlashCommand command="/bonus.d29" />

```
I'm planning my Capstone project. Help me evaluate these ideas:

[YOUR 3 PROJECT IDEAS]

For each, assess:
- Feasibility in 3 days
- Use of course skills
- Personal value
- Portfolio-worthiness

Recommend which to pursue.
```

### Step 2: Define the Breakthrough Goal

```
For my chosen project [PROJECT], help me define:
- The breakthrough goal (ambitious but achievable)
- Why it matters to me
- What success looks like
- How I'll know it's done
```

### Step 3: Create the BMAD Plan

```
Create a BMAD plan for my Capstone project:

Project: [YOUR PROJECT]
Available time: 3 days (Days 29-31)
Skills available: All 28 days of course content

Structure it as:
- Breakthrough Goal
- Method (phases and approach)
- Agents (tools and commands I'll use)
- Deliverables (what I'll produce)

Save to capstone-project/bmad-plan.md
```

### Step 4: Define Day-by-Day Work

```
Break the BMAD plan into 3 days:
- Day 29 (today): Planning + initial setup
- Day 30: Core build
- Day 31: Polish + ship

What should I complete by end of today?
```

### Step 5: Start Day 29 Work

```
Let's begin the Day 29 tasks from the plan. What's first?
```

## Your Turn

Execute the Day 29 tasks from your BMAD plan. By end of today, you should have a clear plan and initial work done.

## What's Next?

Day 30: PRP Framework - Structure the build. Run `/bonus.d30` when you're ready!
