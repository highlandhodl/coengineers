## What You'll Learn

- Polish project to shippable state
- Create documentation and README
- Actually ship/publish the project
- Reflect on the complete journey

## What We're Building

A shipped project. Live. Public. Done.

## Today's Goal

By end of today:
- Project is polished and complete
- Documentation exists
- It's published/shared somewhere
- You can show it to others

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Review What We've Built

<SlashCommand command="/bonus.d31" />

```
Review my Capstone project status:
- What's complete?
- What's incomplete?
- What absolutely must be done to ship?
- What would be nice but can wait?
```

### Step 2: Create the Ship Checklist

```
Create a 'Ship Checklist' with everything needed to launch:
- Content complete
- Design/formatting done
- Documentation written
- Tested/reviewed
- Published
- Shared
```

### Step 3: Polish Sprint

Work through critical items:

```
Let's polish [ITEM]. Make it ship-ready:
- Fix any issues
- Improve quality
- Ensure consistency
```

### Step 4: Create README/Documentation

```
Create documentation for my project:
- What it is
- How to use it
- Who it's for
- How to contribute (if applicable)
```

### Step 5: Ship It

```
Help me publish my project:
- Where should it live? (GitHub, website, etc.)
- What's the publishing process?
- Let's do it now.
```

### Step 6: Create the Announcement

```
Create an announcement for my shipped project:
- LinkedIn post
- Tweet
- Community share

I just completed the 31 Days of Claude Code Capstone!
```

### Step 7: Reflect

```
Create a final reflection at capstone-project/reflection.md:
- What I built
- What I learned
- What I'd do differently
- What's next
```
