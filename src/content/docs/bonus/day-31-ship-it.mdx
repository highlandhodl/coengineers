## What You'll Learn

- Polish project to shippable state
- Create documentation and README
- Actually ship/publish the project
- Reflect on the complete journey

## Today's Goal

By end of today:
- Project is polished and complete
- Documentation exists
- It's published/shared somewhere
- You can show it to others

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/bonus.d31" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to polish, document, and ship your Capstone project.

### What the Command Does

1. **Reviews what's built** - What's complete, what's not?
2. **Creates ship checklist** - What must happen to launch?
3. **Guides the polish sprint** - Fix critical issues
4. **Helps write documentation** - README and guides
5. **Ships it** - Publishes and announces

## Ship Checklist Template

- [ ] Core functionality complete
- [ ] Content reviewed and polished
- [ ] Design/formatting consistent
- [ ] README/documentation written
- [ ] Tested on fresh environment
- [ ] Published to platform
- [ ] Shareable link created
- [ ] Announcement posted
- [ ] Celebrated!

## The Polish Sprint

Focus on what matters:
- **Must fix:** Breaks the experience
- **Should fix:** Noticeably rough
- **Nice to have:** Can wait for v2

Prioritise ruthlessly. Ship beats perfect.

## Documentation Essentials

Your README should cover:
- What it is
