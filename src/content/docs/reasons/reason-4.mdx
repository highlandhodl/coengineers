Twenty labs. Four themes. Here's exactly what you'll build.

---

## The Structure

I've broken this into themes because that's how skills actually develop. Each theme builds on the last. By the end, you've got a complete system for processing information, creating content, and integrating external tools.

---

## [Theme 1: Building Your Digital Workspace](/theme-1/overview/)

**5 Labs** — Setting up your foundation with Obsidian and Claude Code.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 1: First Conversation"
    href="/theme-1/lab-1-first-conversation/"
    description="Your first real interaction with Claude Code"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 2: PARA Structure"
    href="/theme-1/lab-2-para-structure/"
    description="Organised workspace using the PARA method"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 3: Document Templates"
    href="/theme-1/lab-3-document-templates/"
    description="Reusable templates for notes and projects"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 4: Metadata Enrichment"
    href="/theme-1/lab-4-metadata-enrichment/"
    description="Frontmatter and tags for searchable notes"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 5: Project Memory"
    href="/theme-1/lab-5-project-memory/"
    description="CLAUDE.md files that give Claude context"
  />
</CardGrid>

The goal here is confidence. By the end of Theme 1, you should feel comfortable navigating Claude Code and understand how the pieces fit together.

## [Theme 2: Content Processing](/theme-2/overview/)

**5 Labs** — Turning chaos into structure.

This is where things get practical. Most knowledge workers are drowning in content — meeting notes, voice memos, emails, research, videos. Theme 2 gives you tools to process all of it.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 1: Meeting Notes"
    href="/theme-2/lab-1-meeting-notes/"
    description="Turn transcripts into 2-minute summaries"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 2: Audio Transcripts"
    href="/theme-2/lab-2-audio-transcripts/"
    description="Convert rambling audio into polished text"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 3: Email Refinement"
    href="/theme-2/lab-3-email-refinement/"
    description="Tame inbox chaos into action items"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 4: Research Synthesis"
    href="/theme-2/lab-4-research-synthesis/"
    description="Turn bookmarks into searchable knowledge"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 5: YouTube Extraction"
    href="/theme-2/lab-5-youtube-extraction/"
    description="Extract knowledge from video content"
  />
</CardGrid>

By the end of Theme 2, any content that comes in — whatever format — you can process it automatically into something structured and usable.

---

## [Theme 3: Document Creation](/theme-3/overview/)

**5 Labs** — From notes to professional documents.

Theme 2 is about input. Theme 3 is about output. You'll learn to create professional documents using Claude Code's built-in skills.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 1: DOCX Creation"
    href="/theme-3/lab-1-docx-creation/"
    description="Create Word documents with proper formatting"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 2: XLSX Creation"
    href="/theme-3/lab-2-xlsx-creation/"
    description="Build spreadsheets with formulas"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 3: PPTX Creation"
    href="/theme-3/lab-3-pptx-creation/"
    description="Generate presentations from outlines"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 4: Brandkit Creation"
    href="/theme-3/lab-4-brandkit-creation/"
    description="Create brand guideline documents"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 5: SOW Creation"
    href="/theme-3/lab-5-sow-creation/"
    description="Build Statements of Work"
  />
</CardGrid>

This is the theme where you start producing things that would've taken you ages before.

## [Theme 4: External API Integrations](/theme-4/overview/)

**5 Labs** — Extending Claude Code with external tools.

This theme shows you how to supercharge your workflows with external APIs.

<CardGrid>
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 1: Gamma Presentations"
    href="/theme-4/lab-1-gamma-presentations/"
    description="Create stunning presentations with Gamma"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 2: Gemini Images"
    href="/theme-4/lab-2-gemini-images/"
    description="Generate images with Google's Gemini"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 3: ElevenLabs Audio"
    href="/theme-4/lab-3-elevenlabs-audio/"
    description="Convert text to natural speech"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 4: PRD Creation"
    href="/theme-4/lab-4-prd-creation/"
    description="Create Product Requirements Documents"
  />
  <LinkCard
    title="Lab 5: Product Backlog"
    href="/theme-4/lab-5-product-backlog/"
    description="Build prioritised product backlogs"
  />
</CardGrid>

## What You Won't Learn

I want to be clear about what this isn't:

- Not a programming course — you won't learn Python or JavaScript
- Not computer science — no algorithms or data structures
- Not system administration — no server management
- Not machine learning theory — no neural networks or model training

This is a productivity course that uses Claude Code as the engine. If you can follow a recipe, you can follow this course.

---

## The Time Investment

Each lab takes about 20-30 minutes:

- 5-10 minutes watching the video
- 15-20 minutes doing the hands-on practice

That's less than a Netflix episode. Twenty labs total.

The learning investment is measured in hours. The time savings are measured in weeks per year.

## What's Next

Tomorrow: **Who This Course Is For** — and honestly, who it isn't.
