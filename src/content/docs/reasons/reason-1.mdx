title: The Lie I Believed
description: Why "I'm not technical" is a story, not a fact

I joined the RAF when I was 16. I was also a really young father. Looking back, that was a lot to take on. But those ten years were some of the best of my life.

I worked in air traffic control, fighter control, Search and Rescue. None of it felt "technical" at the time. It was just the job. Information flowing, patterns emerging, decisions being made quickly. I didn't think of myself as a tech person. I was just someone who got good at spotting signals in noise.

## The Lie

Here's what I believed for years: some people are technical and some people aren't. You're either born with the brain for it or you're not.

That's a lie. I know because I've lived the opposite.

After the RAF, I moved into cyber security at Capgemini. Then Java development at Atos. Then teaching Hadoop and Spark at QA. Then Director of Innovation. Each step felt like I was bluffing my way into rooms I didn't belong in.

But here's the thing — I kept getting better. Not because I had some hidden talent. Because I kept showing up and learning.

The "technical" people I met along the way weren't a different species. They'd just started earlier or had more practice. That's it.

## The Shift

With Teach the Nation to Code, I watched this play out thousands of times. People would walk into our workshops convinced technology wasn't for them. Career changers. People at job centres. Folks who'd never written a line of code.

By the end of the day, most of them were signing up for bootcamps.

The shift wasn't teaching them to code. It was showing them the door was never as closed as they thought.

## Why This Matters Now

The tools have changed. Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI — these aren't developer tools anymore. They're thinking tools that happen to produce code.

The gap between "I have an idea" and "I have a working thing" has never been smaller. But most people still believe the lie. They think this stuff isn't for them.

It is.

If you understand customer problems, if you know what needs to be built, if you've ever thought "I wish I could just make this myself" — the barrier is lower than you think.
