## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d23" label="Build your backlog" />

## What You'll Learn

- Decompose a product into user stories
- Use MoSCoW prioritisation (Must/Should/Could/Won't)
- Estimate with story points
- Identify dependencies between stories

## The Scenario

Jamie's got the Whisky Club PRP approved by Fiona. "Brilliant," she says. "Now how do we actually build this? And what should we tackle first?"

## Key Concepts

| Concept           | Description                                     |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **User Stories**  | Bite-sized chunks a team can estimate and track |
| **MoSCoW Method** | P1 (Must), P2 (Should), P3 (Nice to have)       |
| **Story Points**  | Complexity estimate: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, or 13       |
| **Dependencies**  | Which stories must complete before others       |

## What You'll Create

- Product backlog in Excel format
- Story titles with action verbs
- Priority levels for each story
- Story point estimates
- Dependency mapping

## Quick Reference

- Start stories with a verb - "Register new member" not "Registration"
- Keep stories independent - each delivers value alone
- Right-size them - 3-5 points is the sweet spot
- If > 13 points, break it down
