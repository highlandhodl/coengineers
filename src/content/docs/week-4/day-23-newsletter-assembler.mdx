## What You'll Learn

- Curate content for newsletters
- Write email-friendly copy
- Structure sections for scanability
- Create consistent newsletter formats

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn is building an email list. They need a monthly newsletter that's worth opening. Jamie needs a system.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d23" />


Create email newsletters people actually open.

## What We're Building
A complete newsletter from your content, ready to send.

## The Scenario
Thistle & Thorn's email list is growing. They need a monthly
newsletter that keeps subscribers engaged and drives visits
to the distillery.

## Newsletter Structure

```
1. SUBJECT LINE - Makes them open
2. PREVIEW TEXT - The snippet they see
3. GREETING - Personal, warm
4. MAIN STORY - One key piece of content
5. QUICK BITS - 2-3 shorter items
6. CTA - What you want them to do
7. SIGN-OFF - Human, not corporate
```

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Create the Newsletter Assembler
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/assemble-newsletter.md:

# Assemble Newsletter

You are helping me create an email newsletter from my content.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Main story/content piece
- 2-3 shorter items (optional)
- Any news/announcements
- Desired CTA
- Month/date for the newsletter

## Your Task
Create a newsletter with:

1. **Subject Lines** - 3 options (curiosity, benefit, timely)
2. **Preview Text** - First line visible in inbox (40-90 chars)
3. **Greeting** - Warm, personal opening
4. **Main Story** - The feature content (3-4 paragraphs max)
5. **Quick Bits** - 2-3 short items with one-line intros
6. **CTA** - Clear action
7. **Sign-off** - Personal, human

## Email Writing Rules
- Short paragraphs (1-2 sentences)
- One idea per paragraph
- Scannable format
- Links clearly visible
- Mobile-friendly (no wide images/tables)

## Tone
Warm, personal, like a letter from a friend who happens
to run a distillery. Not corporate, not salesy."

### Step 2: Create December Newsletter
"Assemble the December newsletter for Thistle & Thorn:

Main story: The Christmas Tasting Event (Dec 15-20)
- 20 guests per evening
- Whisky and chocolate pairings
- Meet Fiona, hear the family story
- £45 per person, includes take-home dram

Quick bits:
- New 12-year batch just released
- Blog post: Age vs Quality (link)
- Instagram: Behind the scenes with Hamish

Announcement: Closed Dec 24-26, reopening Dec 27

CTA: Book your spot at the tasting event

Save to week-4-outputs/newsletter-december.md"

### Step 3: Create Subject Line Generator
"Create a slash command generate-subjects.md that takes
a newsletter topic and generates 10 subject line options
using different psychological triggers (curiosity, urgency,
benefit, etc.)."

### Step 4: Quick Newsletter Template
"Create a reusable template at templates/newsletter-template.md
that I can use as a starting point each month. Include all
sections with placeholder prompts."

## Subject Line Formulas

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Curiosity | "We tried something new. Here's what happened." |
| Benefit | "Your invite to taste whisky you can't buy" |
| Urgency | "Only 12 spots left for December" |
| Personal | "A note from Fiona about the holidays" |
| Story | "The cask that almost got away" |

## Your Turn
Create a newsletter for something you're working on.
Test different subject lines. See what feels right.

## What You Learned
- Newsletters need structure and consistency
- Subject lines are everything
- Short paragraphs for email
- Personal beats professional

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/assemble-newsletter.md`
- `.claude/commands/generate-subjects.md`
- `templates/newsletter-template.md`
- `newsletter-december.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 24: Case Study Packager](/week-4/day-24-case-study-packager/), we'll turn projects into compelling case studies.
