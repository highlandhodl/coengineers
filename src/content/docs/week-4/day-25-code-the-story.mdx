<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w4.d25" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d25" label="Code your story" />

## What You'll Learn

- How specifications guide implementation
- Work with Claude on any technology stack
- Implementation patterns for common features
- The value of spec-driven development

## The Scenario

Jamie's got the user story for Member Registration locked down. Every scenario documented, every edge case considered. Now it's time to build.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                     | Description                                      |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Spec-Driven Development** | Hand Claude the spec, get implementation         |
| **Technology Agnostic**     | Works with React, Python, Node, Astro - anything |
| **File Structure First**    | Review architecture before code                  |
| **Acceptance = Tests**      | Each criterion becomes a test case               |

## What You'll Create

- Working implementation files
- Code comments explaining decisions
- Implementation summary
- Instructions to run it

## Quick Reference

- Trust the spec - unclear implementation means unclear story
- Review structure first - architecture beats refactoring
- Run it early - don't wait until the end to test
- You pick the technology - Claude adapts
