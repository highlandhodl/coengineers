## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d24" />


Turn your project wins into compelling case studies.

## What We're Building
A professional case study from project notes, with clear
problem-solution-results structure.

## The Scenario
Edinburgh Tech Company booked a team-building whisky tasting.
25 people, private tour, custom tasting, dinner. It was a hit.
Now we want to attract more corporate clients.

## Case Study Structure

```
1. HEADLINE - Results-focused
2. OVERVIEW - Client + challenge + outcome (one paragraph)
3. THE CHALLENGE - What problem they faced
4. THE SOLUTION - What we did
5. THE RESULTS - Measurable outcomes
6. QUOTE - In their words
7. CTA - Want the same?
```

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Create the Case Study Packager
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/package-case-study.md:

# Package Case Study

You are helping me turn project notes into a case study.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Project notes and details
- Client information (may need to anonymise)
- Problem they faced
- What we did
- Results/outcomes
- Any quotes or feedback

## Your Task
Create a case study with:

1. **Headline** - Focus on the result, not the client
   - Example: 'How a tech company rebuilt team morale with whisky'

2. **Overview Box**
   - Client: [Name/type]
   - Industry: [Sector]
   - Challenge: [One line]
   - Result: [One line]

3. **The Challenge** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What was the situation?
   - Why did it matter?
   - What had they tried before?

4. **The Solution** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What did we propose?
   - How did we deliver?
   - What made it special?

5. **The Results** (bullets or numbers)
   - Measurable outcomes
   - Qualitative feedback
   - Follow-on effects

6. **Quote** (if available)
   - In their words
   - Attribution

7. **CTA**
   - Want similar results? Here's how to start.

## Writing Style
- Storytelling, not reporting
- Show, don't tell
- Use specific numbers
- Keep it credible (not overselling)"

### Step 2: Package the Tech Company Case Study
"Create a case study from these notes:

Client: Nexus Solutions (Edinburgh tech company, 120 employees)
Contact: Sarah Chen, Head of People

The Challenge:
- Remote work had fragmented the team
- In-person events felt forced ('not another pizza party')
- Needed something memorable to rebuild connections
- Budget: £2000 for 25 senior team members

What We Did:
- Private after-hours distillery tour
- Hamish explained cask selection (hands-on)
- Tasting of 4 whiskies with food pairings
- Created a 'Nexus Single Cask' concept (their own future cask)
- Group dinner in the tasting room

Results:
- NPS of the event: 94
- 3 attendees booked personal visits within a month
- They've already asked about an annual booking
- Sarah shared on LinkedIn (18,000 impressions)

Quote from Sarah: 'This was the first team event where nobody
checked their phone. Genuinely special.'

Save to week-4-outputs/case-study-nexus.md"

### Step 3: Create Anonymised Version
"Create a version of the case study that doesn't name the
client - for use before getting formal approval. Call them
'A leading Edinburgh tech company'."

### Step 4: Case Study Template
"Create a template at templates/case-study-template.md
that I can reuse for future case studies."

### Step 5: Quick Win Version
"Create a slash command case-study-quick.md that creates a
one-page case study summary (200-300 words) for quick sharing."

## Case Study Tips

1. **Get permission** before publishing with client name
2. **Use specifics** - "94 NPS" beats "great feedback"
3. **Include photos** if possible (add [PHOTO: description])
4. **Focus on results** the reader wants
5. **Make it skimmable** - headers, bullets, bold text

## Your Turn
Think of a project that went well. Package it as a case study.
Even if you can't publish it, the exercise is valuable.

## What You Learned
- Case studies are stories with structure
- Results matter more than process
- Quotes add credibility
- Permission is essential

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/package-case-study.md`
- `.claude/commands/case-study-quick.md`
- `templates/case-study-template.md`
- `case-study-nexus.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 25: Proposal Generator](/week-4/day-25-proposal-generator/), we'll turn meeting notes into professional proposals.
