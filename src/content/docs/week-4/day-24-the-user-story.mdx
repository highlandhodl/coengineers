## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d24" label="Detail your user story" />

## What You'll Learn

- The anatomy of a great user story
- Write acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then)
- Think through edge cases
- Define "Definition of Done"

## The Scenario

Jamie's picked the highest-priority story: Member Registration. Before handing it to a developer (or Claude), Jamie needs to specify exactly how it should work. What if they enter a bad email? What if they're already a member?

## Key Concepts

| Concept                 | Description                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Story Format**   | As a [user], I want [capability], So that [benefit]      |
| **Acceptance Criteria** | Given [context], When [action], Then [result]            |
| **Edge Cases**          | The weird situations - already registered, invalid email |
| **Definition of Done**  | Checklist that confirms complete                         |

## What You'll Create

- User story statement with clear benefit
- Acceptance criteria for happy path
- Error scenario handling
- Edge case documentation
- Definition of Done checklist

## Quick Reference

- Be specific - "User sees 'Email already registered'" not "User sees error"
- Cover unhappy paths - what if validation fails?
- Make criteria testable - if you can't write a test, rewrite
- One behaviour per criterion
