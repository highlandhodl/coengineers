## What You'll Learn

- Transform scattered notes into cohesive blog posts
- Write compelling hooks and CTAs
- Structure content for readability
- Optimise for SEO basics

## The Scenario

Jamie has notes from distillery visits, conversations with Fiona, and research about whisky trends. Time to turn them into blog posts that drive traffic.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d22" />


Transform your notes into publishable blog posts.

## What We're Building
A complete blog post from scattered notes, with hooks, structure,
and calls to action.

## The Scenario
Jamie has 6 months of notes about whisky-making, customer stories,
and industry trends. Fiona wants a blog on the website. It's time
to turn notes into content.

## Blog Post Anatomy

1. **Hook** - First line that grabs attention
2. **Context** - Why this matters to the reader
3. **Body** - The main content (structured with subheadings)
4. **Takeaway** - What the reader should remember
5. **CTA** - What you want them to do next

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Create the Blog Compiler
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/compile-blog.md:

# Compile Blog Post

You are helping me turn notes into a publishable blog post.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Source notes (can be multiple, messy)
- Target audience
- Desired length (short: 500w, medium: 1000w, long: 1500w+)
- Any SEO keywords to include
- Call to action

## Your Task
Create a complete blog post with:

1. **Title Options** - 3 headline options (curiosity, benefit, how-to)
2. **Hook** - Opening that grabs attention
3. **Body** - Structured content with H2/H3 subheadings
4. **Takeaways** - Key points summarised
5. **CTA** - Clear next action for reader
6. **Meta** - Suggested meta description (155 chars)

## Writing Style
- British English
- Conversational but authoritative
- Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences max)
- Use 'you' and 'your' - speak to the reader
- Include examples and specifics

## Output Format
Markdown with frontmatter (title, description, author, date, tags)"

### Step 2: Compile a Thistle & Thorn Blog Post
"Compile a blog post from these notes:

Topic: The Difference Between Age and Quality in Whisky

Notes:
- Age statement is a marketing tool, not quality guarantee
- Cask quality matters more than years
- Climate affects maturation speed (Scotland slower than Kentucky)
- A 10-year in good cask beats 18-year in tired cask
- Smaller distilleries often use better casks
- Tasting notes matter more than age
- Price often reflects age, not quality
- Tips for choosing whisky without fixating on age

Target audience: Whisky curious, not experts
Length: Medium (1000 words)
SEO keyword: 'choosing whisky by age'
CTA: Sign up for our tasting notes newsletter

Save to week-4-outputs/blog-age-vs-quality.md"

### Step 3: Add SEO Enhancement
"Create a slash command enhance-blog-seo.md that takes a
draft blog post and:
- Suggests header improvements for SEO
- Recommends internal/external links
- Adds alt text suggestions for images
- Optimises the meta description"

### Step 4: Create a Content Series
"Using the age vs quality blog as a starting point, suggest
3 more blog posts that could form a 'Whisky Wisdom' series.
Give titles and brief outlines for each."

### Step 5: Quick Blog Mode
"Create a slash command blog-quick.md that creates a
500-word blog post from a single topic sentence. Minimal
input, maximum output."

## Hook Formulas for Blogs

| Formula | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Contrarian | "Everything you know about whisky age is wrong." |
| Question | "Would you pay £100 more for 6 extra years?" |
| Story | "Last week, a customer chose our 10-year over an 18-year. Here's why." |
| Statistic | "87% of whisky buyers focus on the wrong thing." |
| How-to | "How to spot a great whisky without looking at the label." |

## Your Turn
Find notes on a topic you know well. Run them through the
blog compiler. Create a post you could actually publish.

## What You Learned
- Notes → blog is a structured process
- Hooks determine if anyone reads further
- Structure aids readability
- CTAs convert readers to action

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/compile-blog.md`
- `.claude/commands/enhance-blog-seo.md`
- `.claude/commands/blog-quick.md`
- `blog-age-vs-quality.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 23: Newsletter Assembler](/week-4/day-23-newsletter-assembler/), we'll build email newsletters that people actually want to read.
