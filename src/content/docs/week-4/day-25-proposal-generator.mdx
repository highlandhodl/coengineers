## Tone

### Step 2: Generate the Wedding Partnership Proposal
"Generate a proposal from these meeting notes:

Call: Megan Fraser, Fraser Events (wedding planning)
Date: Yesterday

What she wants:
- Whisky experience as part of wedding packages
- Could be at distillery or at venue
- Expecting 5-10 weddings per year to start
- Typically 20-40 guests for the whisky bit
- Budget varies, wants options

What we discussed:
- Option 1: Group visits to distillery (transport their problem)
- Option 2: We come to venue with mobile tasting kit
- Pricing: £40-60 per head depending on package
- She wants exclusivity in Speyside (we said we'd consider)

Her concerns:
- Consistency of experience
- Dietary requirements (gluten in whisky?)
- Wet weather backup for distillery visits

Next steps: Send proposal, she'll respond within a week

Save to week-4-outputs/proposal-fraser-events.md"

### Step 3: Create Pricing Options Table
"Add a pricing table to the proposal with 3 options:
- Silver: Basic tasting (4 whiskies, 1 hour, £40/head)
- Gold: Full experience (6 whiskies, food, 2 hours, £55/head)
- Platinum: Private tour + dinner (3 hours, £80/head)

Include minimum group sizes and what's included in each."

### Step 4: Proposal Template
"Create a reusable template at templates/proposal-template.md
with all sections as placeholders."

### Step 5: Quick Quote Mode
"Create a slash command quick-quote.md that generates just
the scope and pricing sections - for when you don't need a
full proposal."

## Proposal Tips

1. **Recap their needs first** - shows you listened
2. **Offer options** - gives them control
3. **Be specific on scope** - prevents disputes
4. **Include a deadline** - creates urgency
5. **Make next steps crystal clear**

## Your Turn
Think of something you could propose to a client or
colleague. Create a proposal even as practice.

## What You Learned
- Proposals have a reliable structure
- Recapping needs builds trust
- Options give clients control
- Clear next steps drive action

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/generate-proposal.md`
- `.claude/commands/quick-quote.md`
- `templates/proposal-template.md`
- `proposal-fraser-events.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 26: Competitive Intel](/week-4/day-26-competitive-intel/), we'll create competitive analysis reports.
