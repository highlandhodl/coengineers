# Week 4: Building Software

**Theme:** "From idea to shipped product in 7 days."

This week, you'll build a complete product feature from idea to deployment. Each day adds a piece to the puzzle, and by Day 28, you'll have something real to ship.

## The Approach: Spec-Driven Development

We're using **spec-driven development** — writing specifications before code. Research shows that 1 structured iteration matches the accuracy of 8 unstructured attempts. Structure beats iteration.

Each day uses an **interactive slash command** that guides you through the process. Claude asks questions, you answer, and together you create something real.

## What You'll Learn

- Create a Product Requirements Prompt (PRP)
- Build a prioritised product backlog with MoSCoW
- Write detailed user stories with acceptance criteria
- Implement features with Claude Code
- Test and verify your implementation
- Document for users and developers
- Deploy and ship your product
