import SlashCommand from '../../../components/SlashCommand.astro';
import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w4.d22" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d22" label="Capture your product idea" />

## What You'll Learn

- Articulate a product idea clearly
- Structure a Product Requirements Prompt
- Define success before writing code
- Master the art of saying "no" (out of scope)

## The Scenario

Fiona's been getting requests from loyal customers who want "more" from Thistle & Thorn. They've bought the whisky, done the tours, and now they want an ongoing relationship. What if they had a Whisky Club?

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                               |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Statement** | Who has the problem and why it matters    |
| **Success Criteria**  | How you'll know it's working (measurable) |
| **User Personas**     | 2-3 types of people who'll use it         |
| **Out of Scope**      | What you're explicitly not building       |

## What You'll Create

- Clear problem statement
- Measurable success criteria
- User personas with goals and pain points
- Prioritised feature list (P1/P2/P3)
- Explicit exclusions and known constraints

## Quick Reference

- Be specific about the problem - "more engagement" is vague
- Make success measurable - "50 members in first month"
- Say no clearly - the "out of scope" section prevents scope creep
- The PRP becomes your north star for the rest of the week
