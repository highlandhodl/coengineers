## What You'll Learn

- Chunk content for retrieval
- Add metadata for searchability
- Format Q&A pairs
- Prepare for RAG ingestion

## The Scenario

Thistle & Thorn wants a chatbot on their website to answer customer questions. Jamie needs to prepare the content for training.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d27" />


Prepare content for chatbot and RAG systems.

## What We're Building
Training data for a chatbot or RAG system, properly chunked
and formatted with metadata.

## The Scenario
The website gets the same questions repeatedly:
- What are your opening hours?
- Do you ship internationally?
- Can we book a private tour?

A chatbot could handle this. But it needs training data.

## RAG Basics

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):
1. Content is chunked into pieces
2. Chunks are embedded (vectorised)
3. User asks a question
4. Relevant chunks are retrieved
5. LLM generates answer from chunks

Good training data = good answers.

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Create the Chatbot Trainer
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/prepare-chatbot-data.md:

# Prepare Chatbot Training Data

You are helping me prepare content for chatbot/RAG training.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Source content (FAQs, docs, website copy)
- The context (what the chatbot is for)

## Your Task
Create training-ready content:

1. **Content Chunks**
   - Break into semantic units (one topic per chunk)
   - 100-300 words per chunk ideal
   - Include enough context in each chunk

2. **Metadata per Chunk**
   - Category (e.g., 'tours', 'products', 'practical')
   - Keywords
   - Source document

3. **Q&A Pairs** (if appropriate)
   - Question: How a user might ask
   - Answer: The response
   - Variations: Other ways to ask

4. **Entity Extraction**
   - Key facts (hours, prices, policies)
   - Named entities (products, people)

## Output Format
JSON-like structure or markdown with clear sections.
Each chunk should be self-contained."

### Step 2: Prepare Thistle & Thorn FAQ Data

### Step 3: Create Q&A Pairs
"From the FAQ content, generate 10 Q&A pairs with 3 question
variations each. Format for chatbot training."

### Step 4: Chunk Long-Form Content
"Take the 'Age vs Quality' blog post from Day 22 and chunk
it for RAG ingestion. Add appropriate metadata to each chunk."

### Step 5: Export Formats
"Create exports of the training data in:
1. JSON format (for most chatbot platforms)
2. CSV format (for spreadsheet review)"

## Your Turn
Take some content you have (FAQ, documentation, guides)
and prepare it for chatbot training.

## What You Learned
- Chunking is crucial for retrieval
- Metadata improves search
- Q&A pairs with variations help coverage
- Self-contained chunks beat fragments

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/prepare-chatbot-data.md`
- `chatbot-training-data.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 28: Week 4 Review](/week-4/day-28-week-4-review/), we'll consolidate your business content factory.
