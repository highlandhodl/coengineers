## Let's Go

### Step 1: Audit Your Business Commands
"List all slash commands I created during Week 4. For each:
- Show the file path
- One-line description
- When I'd use it"

### Step 2: Create Week 4 Retrospective
"Create a retrospective at 01-projects/learning-claude-code/
week-4-retro.md with:
- Frontmatter: date, week: 4
- Business content I created
- Which command I'll use most
- Ideas for my own business/work"

### Step 3: Build a Business Content Router
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/create-business.md
that asks what type of business content I need, then routes
to the appropriate creator:
- Blog → compile-blog
- Newsletter → assemble-newsletter
- Case study → package-case-study
- Proposal → generate-proposal
- Competitor analysis → analyze-competitors
- Chatbot data → prepare-chatbot-data"

### Step 4: Preview the Capstone
The next 3 days are the Capstone - you'll build and ship
a real project using frameworks.

"Review everything I've built over 4 weeks. Suggest 3 project
ideas I could build in the Capstone that would:
1. Use skills from multiple weeks
2. Be genuinely useful
3. Be achievable in 3 days"

### Step 5: Prepare for Launch
"Create a folder at 01-projects/capstone-project/ for the
Capstone work. Add a README with space for:
- Project idea
- Why I'm building it
- Who it's for
- What success looks like"
