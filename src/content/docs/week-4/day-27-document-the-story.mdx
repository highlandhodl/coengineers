import SlashCommand from '../../../components/SlashCommand.astro';
import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w4.d27" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d27" label="Document your story" />

## What You'll Learn

- Write documentation for different audiences
- README structure and conventions
- API documentation patterns
- Architecture decision records

## The Scenario

Jamie's proud of Member Registration. It works beautifully. But Sarah from IT has questions: "How do I set this up? What environment variables does it need?" The code is only half the job.

## Key Concepts

| Concept              | Description                                                 |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Audience Matters** | End users, developers, and future you need different things |
| **README Structure** | What, Quick Start, Features, Installation, Usage, Config    |
| **Real Examples**    | Not `foo` and `bar` - actual working code                   |
| **Document Gotchas** | What tripped you up? Save others the pain                   |

## What You'll Create

- README with setup and usage
- API reference (if applicable)
- Architecture notes for maintainers
- Troubleshooting guide

## Quick Reference

- Start with why - before "how", explain "why"
- Include real examples - code someone can copy
- Keep it updated - outdated docs are worse than none
- Document the gotchas - save others the pain
