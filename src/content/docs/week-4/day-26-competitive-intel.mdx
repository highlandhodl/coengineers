## What You'll Learn

- Structure competitive analysis
- Compare features and positioning
- Identify opportunities and threats
- Create actionable intel reports

## The Scenario

Fiona wants to understand what other Speyside distilleries are doing. Are they offering experiences? What do they charge? How do they market themselves?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d26" />


Create structured competitive analysis from research.

## What We're Building
A competitive intelligence report that identifies opportunities
and threats from competitor analysis.

## The Scenario
Three other Speyside distilleries are within 10 miles. Fiona wants
to know: What are they doing? What can we learn? Where can we win?

## Competitive Analysis Structure

```
1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY - Key findings
2. COMPETITOR PROFILES - Who they are
3. COMPARISON MATRIX - Features side by side
4. PRICING ANALYSIS - What they charge
5. STRENGTHS & WEAKNESSES - Per competitor
6. OPPORTUNITIES - Where we can win
7. THREATS - What to watch
8. RECOMMENDATIONS - What to do next
```

## Let's Go

### Step 1: Create the Competitor Analyzer
"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/analyze-competitors.md:

# Analyze Competitors

You are helping me create a competitive analysis report.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Our company/product details
- Competitor information (can be notes, websites, research)
- Specific questions to answer

## Your Task
Create a competitive analysis with:

1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
   - Key findings
   - Main opportunities
   - Primary threats

2. **Competitor Profiles** (per competitor)
   - Name and overview
   - Products/services
   - Target market
   - Positioning

3. **Comparison Matrix** (table)
   - Key features/offerings
   - Us vs each competitor
   - Use ✓, ✗, ~ for yes/no/partial

4. **Pricing Comparison** (if available)
   - Their prices vs ours
   - Value positioning

5. **SWOT per Competitor**
   - Their strengths
   - Their weaknesses

6. **Opportunities**
   - Gaps we can fill
   - Weaknesses we can exploit
   - Unserved segments

7. **Threats**
   - Where they're stronger
   - What they might do
   - Market shifts

8. **Recommendations** (3-5 bullets)
   - Specific actions to take
   - Prioritised

## Tone
Analytical, objective, actionable."

### Step 2: Analyze Speyside Competitors
"Create a competitive analysis for Thistle & Thorn:

Our positioning: Family distillery, authentic experience,
premium but accessible, 4th generation

Competitor 1: Glen Morrison Distillery
- Larger, corporate-owned (bought by big brand 2019)
- Slick visitor centre, café, shop
- Tours: £20 (basic), £50 (premium)
- High volume, less personal
- Great website, professional marketing

Competitor 2: Cairn Spirits
- Similar size to us, family-owned
- Focus on gin more than whisky
- Tours: £25 (combined whisky/gin)
- Strong local following
- Weak online presence

Competitor 3: The Whisky Collective
- Not a distillery - a whisky experience venue
- Partners with multiple distilleries
- Tours: N/A, tastings from £30
- Modern, millennial-focused
- Excellent Instagram

Save to week-4-outputs/competitive-analysis-speyside.md"

### Step 3: Create Quick Competitor Profile
"Create a slash command competitor-profile.md that creates
a one-page profile of a single competitor from notes or
website research."

### Step 4: Opportunity Finder
"Based on the competitive analysis, create a 'Top 5
Opportunities' summary document with specific actions
Thistle & Thorn could take."

## Your Turn
Identify 2-3 competitors in your space. Research them
(websites, social, reviews). Run the analysis.

## What You Learned
- Structured analysis beats gut feel
- Comparison matrices reveal gaps
- Competitor weaknesses = opportunities
- Regular updates keep it relevant

## Example Outputs
- `.claude/commands/analyze-competitors.md`
- `.claude/commands/competitor-profile.md`
- `competitive-analysis-speyside.md`

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 27: Chatbot Trainer](/week-4/day-27-chatbot-trainer/), we'll prepare content for chatbot and RAG training.
