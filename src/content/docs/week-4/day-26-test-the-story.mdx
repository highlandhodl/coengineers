## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w4.d26" label="Test your story" />

## What You'll Learn

- Test against acceptance criteria
- Write meaningful test descriptions
- Test happy paths and edge cases
- Gain confidence from tests

## The Scenario

Jamie's built Member Registration. It looks good. Clicking through manually, everything works. But Jamie's been burned before. "I need to know this works. Properly. Every scenario."

## Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                       |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Criterion = Test**     | Every acceptance criterion gets at least one test |
| **Descriptive Names**    | `should show error when email is invalid`         |
| **Independent Tests**    | Each runs in isolation, no dependencies           |
| **Fast & Deterministic** | Same input, same result, every time               |

## What You'll Create

- Test suite covering every acceptance criterion
- Error handling tests
- Edge case coverage
- Test summary with coverage details

## Quick Reference

- Map tests to criteria - every criterion, at least one test
- Descriptive names - know what failed at a glance
- Mock external dependencies - keep tests fast
- Run early, run often
