No theory. No abstract concepts. Here's exactly what you'll create.

---

## The Portfolio

By Day 31, you'll own:

**28 slash commands.** Your personal automation library. Run anytime, forever. These aren't training materials — they're tools that stay with you.

**A knowledge system.** Organised notes with CLAUDE.md files, templates, and metadata schemas. Everything connected, everything searchable.

**A content pipeline.** Input → Process → Output workflows for any content type you encounter.

**A software workflow.** Spec-driven development with Speckit. Build tools without traditional coding.

---

## Week 1: Foundation

Your digital workspace takes shape.

| Day | What You Build | The Outcome |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | First Conversation | Confident interaction with Claude Code |
| 2 | Your Digital Home | Organised workspace using PARA method |
| 3 | Project Memory | CLAUDE.md files that give Claude context |
| 4 | Template Factory | Reusable prompt templates |
| 5 | The Daily Note | Daily documentation system |
| 6 | Your First Slash Command | Custom automation you run with one command |
| 7 | Week 1 Review | Complete mini-project using all skills |

**What you walk away with:** A fully organised knowledge system with templates, project memory, and your first working slash command.

---

## Week 2: Content Processing

Any input becomes structured output.

| Day | What You Build | The Outcome |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 8 | Meeting Tamer | 47-minute transcripts → 2-minute summaries |
| 9 | Voice to Text | Stream of consciousness → polished text |
| 10 | YouTube Brain | Hours of video → captured knowledge |
| 11 | PDF Crusher | Locked documents → liberated data |
| 12 | Web Archiver | Bookmarks → searchable knowledge |
| 13 | Email Processor | Inbox chaos → action items |
| 14 | Week 2 Review | Unified content processing pipeline |

**What you walk away with:** Seven processing commands that handle any content you throw at them. Meetings, voice memos, videos, PDFs, web pages, emails — all automated.

---

## Week 3: Creative Outputs

From notes to publishable content.

| Day | What You Build | The Outcome |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 15 | Presentation Builder | Notes → Gamma-ready slide outlines |
| 16 | Image Prompter | Concepts → optimised Gemini prompts |
| 17 | Audio Script Writer | Text → ElevenLabs-ready scripts |
| 18 | Diagram Generator | Ideas → valid Mermaid diagrams |
| 19 | Social Thread Maker | Ideas → platform-specific posts |
| 20 | Video Brief Creator | Scripts → HeyGen avatar briefs |
| 21 | Week 3 Review | Kling video prompts + creative toolkit |

**What you walk away with:** Seven commands that turn your thinking into presentations, images, audio, diagrams, social content, and video briefs.

This is where the JSON structure approach to image prompts comes in. Building prompts logically, iterating systematically. Software engineering for visuals.

---

## Week 4: Building Software

From idea to shipped feature.

| Day | What You Build | The Outcome |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 22 | The Product Idea | Product Requirements Prompt (PRP) |
| 23 | The Product Backlog | Prioritised backlog in spreadsheet |
| 24 | The User Story | Detailed story with acceptance criteria |
| 25 | Code the Story | Working implementation from specs |
| 26 | Test the Story | Test suite covering all criteria |
| 27 | Document the Story | README, API docs, architecture notes |
| 28 | Ship It! | Deployed feature + retrospective |

**What you walk away with:** A complete software development cycle. Idea → Spec → Plan → Tasks → Implementation → Tests → Documentation → Deployment.

You won't write traditional code. You'll describe what you want and let Claude Code build it.

<Aside type="note" title="This actually works">
The CoEngineers website was built this way. So were several internal tools I use daily. Spec-driven development isn't theoretical — it's how I work.

## Bonus: Days 29-31

Advanced frameworks and capstone.

| Day | What You Learn | The Outcome |
|-----|----------------|-------------|
| 29 | BMAD Method | Plan complex projects with clear structure |
| 30 | PRP Framework | Master Prompt-Response-Product pattern |
| 31 | Ship It! Capstone | Complete capstone using all skills |

**What you walk away with:** The higher-level thinking that ties everything together. Plus a shipped capstone project to prove mastery.

## How It All Connects

When you put the pieces together:

```
INPUTS (Week 2)
Voice Memos | Meetings | PDFs | Videos | Web Pages | Email
                           ↓
PROCESSING
Transcribe | Extract | Structure | Organise
                           ↓
KNOWLEDGE SYSTEM (Week 1)
CLAUDE.md | Templates | Schemas | Organisation
                           ↓
              ┌────────────┴────────────┐
              ↓                         ↓
      CREATIVE (Week 3)          SOFTWARE (Week 4)
   Decks | Audio | Video         Speckit → Deployed
```

Each arrow is a slash command. Each box is a skill you'll build.

## A Real Example

**Starting point:** A 45-minute client discovery call.

**Commands used:**
1. Meeting Tamer → Structured transcript with themes
2. Presentation Builder → Slide outline for follow-up
3. Social Thread Maker → LinkedIn post about the topic
4. The Product Idea → PRP for potential feature

**Time:** 15 minutes.

**Old way:** 4+ hours of manual work across scattered tools.

## What You Own Forever

After 31 days, this is your permanent toolkit:

| Category | Assets |
|----------|--------|
| Foundation | CLAUDE.md, templates, schemas |
| Processing | 7 content processing commands |
| Creative | 7 output generation commands |
| Software | Speckit workflow |
| Frameworks | BMAD, PRP methodologies |

These aren't course materials you forget. They're working systems you use daily.
