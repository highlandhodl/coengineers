# My Claude Code Story

<Badge text="Week 1" variant="note" /> <Badge text="5 min read" variant="tip" />

I've tried every AI tool going. This is the one that stuck.

## The Problem With Every Other Tool

Before Claude Code, my AI workflow looked like this:

<Steps>
  1. Open ChatGPT in a browser tab 2. Copy content from a file 3. Paste into chat 4. Wait for
  response 5. Copy response 6. Paste into a new file 7. Repeat 47 times 8. Lose the will to live
</Steps>

Every. Single. Time.

The AI was useful. The workflow was painful. I spent more time copying and pasting than actually thinking.

## What Makes Claude Code Different

Claude Code isn't a chatbot. It's an AI that can actually _do things_.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="It reads your files" icon="document">
    No more copy-paste. Point Claude at a folder and it reads everything. Context? Handled.
  </Card>
  <Card title="It writes files directly" icon="pencil">
    Output goes straight to your filesystem. No more copying responses into documents.
  </Card>
  <Card title="It runs commands" icon="laptop">
    Need to process something? Convert a format? Claude can run terminal commands directly.
  </Card>
  <Card title="It chains everything" icon="random">
    Read this file, transform it, write it there, then do the same for the next 50. One command.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## My "Holy Shit" Moment

Two weeks after installing Claude Code, I had a task:

> Process 12 hours of interview recordings into structured case studies.

Old workflow:

- Transcribe with Whisper (manual)
- Clean up transcripts (manual)
- Extract key quotes (manual)
- Structure into case study format (manual)
- Repeat for each interview

Time estimate: 3 days.

With Claude Code, I wrote one slash command:

```bash
/process-interview
```

It:

1. Found all audio files in the folder
2. Ran Whisper on each one
3. Cleaned up the transcripts
4. Extracted key themes and quotes
5. Generated structured case studies
6. Saved everything with proper filenames

Time taken: **47 minutes**. While I made coffee.

<Aside type="tip" title="This is the course">
  That slash command? That's Day 25. You'll build it yourself.

## What I've Built Since

Here's a sample of the automations running in my Claude Code setup:

| Command          | What It Does                                     | Time Saved       |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------- |
| `/meeting-notes` | Transforms raw transcripts into structured notes | 30 min → 2 min   |
| `/blog-draft`    | Turns voice memos into blog post outlines        | 2 hours → 10 min |
| `/deck-prep`     | Creates Gamma-ready presentation content         | 1 day → 1 hour   |
| `/newsletter`    | Assembles weekly newsletter from notes           | 3 hours → 15 min |
| `/proposal`      | Generates client proposals from briefs           | 4 hours → 30 min |

Each one took an afternoon to build. Each one saves hours every week.

## Why Not Just Use ChatGPT?

Fair question. ChatGPT is great for:

- Quick questions
- Brainstorming
- One-off tasks

But for **repeated workflows**? For **file processing**? For **anything involving your actual work files**?

ChatGPT hits a wall:

- No file system access
- No command execution
- No persistent context
- No automation

Claude Code breaks through that wall.

## The Learning Curve

I won't lie — there's a curve.

If you've never used a terminal, the first few days will feel unfamiliar. But here's the thing: you don't need to become a developer.

You need to learn:

- How to navigate folders
- How to run a slash command
- How to read an error message

That's it. Three skills. Week 1 of the course covers all of them.

## Is It Worth It?

Quick maths:

| Investment                    | Return                       |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 31 days × 30 minutes          | **15.5 hours** learning      |
| 5 hours/week saved × 50 weeks | **250 hours** saved per year |

That's a 16x return on time invested. In the first year alone.
