# My AI Story

<Badge text="Week 1" variant="note" /> <Badge text="5 min read" variant="tip" />

**December 2022.** ChatGPT launches. My LinkedIn feed explodes.

I ignored it for three months.

## The Sceptic Phase

I'd seen enough tech hype cycles to be cynical. Blockchain was going to revolutionise everything. NFTs were the future of art. Web3 would replace the internet.

None of that happened.

So when everyone started posting about AI writing their emails, I rolled my eyes. _Another shiny thing for the productivity bros to obsess over._

<Aside type="tip" title="Spoiler">
  I was wrong. Very wrong.

## The Moment Everything Changed

**March 2023.** A client asks me to summarise 47 meeting transcripts.

Forty-seven.

I quoted them two weeks and a small fortune. Then, out of curiosity, I pasted one into ChatGPT.

Thirty seconds later, I had a better summary than I'd have written myself.

I did all 47 in an afternoon.

<Card title="The realisation">
  This wasn't about replacing thinking. It was about **removing the tedious bits** so I could focus
  on the interesting parts.

## The Rabbit Hole

From there, I fell down the rabbit hole:

- **GPT-4** for writing and analysis
- **Midjourney** for visuals I couldn't design myself
- **ElevenLabs** for voiceovers that didn't sound robotic
- **Whisper** for transcription that actually worked

Each tool solved a specific problem. But they were scattered. Disconnected. I was copying and pasting between a dozen tabs like a madman.

## Then I Found Claude Code

**October 2024.** Anthropic releases Claude Code.

It wasn't just another chatbot. It was an AI that could:

- Read my files
- Write new ones
- Run commands
- Chain tools together

One interface. One conversation. Everything connected.

  <Card title="Before Claude Code" icon="warning">
    - 12 browser tabs - Copy-paste everywhere - Manual file management - Broken workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="After Claude Code" icon="approve-check">
    - One terminal window - Automated pipelines - Files created instantly - Repeatable commands
  </Card>

## Why I'm Building This Course

I spent months figuring out how to use these tools properly. Made every mistake. Broke things. Started over.

You don't need to do that.

This course is the shortcut I wish I'd had. Thirty-one days of practical, hands-on lessons that take you from "what's a terminal?" to "I just automated my entire content workflow."

No fluff. No theory. Just tools you can use immediately.
