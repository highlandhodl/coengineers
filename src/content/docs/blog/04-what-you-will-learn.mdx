title: What You Will Learn
description: A week-by-week breakdown of your 31-day journey

Thirty-one days. Four weeks plus a bonus section. Here's exactly what you'll build.

---

## The Structure

I've broken this into weeks because that's how skills actually develop. Each week builds on the last. By the end, you've got a complete system for processing information, creating content, and building tools.

---

## Week 1: Foundation

**Days 1-7** — Building your digital workspace.

This is where we get you set up properly. By the end of Week 1, you'll have:

- Your first real interaction with Claude Code
- An organised workspace using the PARA method
- CLAUDE.md files that give Claude context about your projects
- Reusable prompt templates
- A daily documentation system
- Your first working slash command

Day 7 is a review day where you put it all together with a mini-project.

The goal here is confidence. By the end of the week, you should feel comfortable navigating Claude Code and understand how the pieces fit together.

## Week 2: Content Processing

**Days 8-14** — Turning chaos into structure.

This is where things get practical. Most knowledge workers are drowning in content — meeting notes, voice memos, PDFs, emails, web pages, videos. Week 2 gives you tools to process all of it.

- **Meeting Tamer** — Turn 47-minute transcripts into 2-minute summaries
- **Voice to Text** — Convert rambling audio into polished text
- **YouTube Brain** — Extract knowledge from video content
- **PDF Crusher** — Get data out of documents
- **Web Archiver** — Turn bookmarks into searchable knowledge
- **Email Processor** — Tame inbox chaos into action items

Day 14 ties it together into a unified content processing pipeline.

By the end of Week 2, any content that comes in — whatever format — you can process it automatically into something structured and usable.

---

## Week 3: Creative Outputs

**Days 15-21** — From notes to publishable content.

Week 2 is about input. Week 3 is about output. You'll learn to generate:

- **Presentations** — Notes to Gamma-ready slide outlines
- **Image prompts** — Detailed prompts optimised for Gemini (the JSON structure approach I mentioned)
- **Audio scripts** — Scripts ready for ElevenLabs with proper pacing
- **Diagrams** — Valid Mermaid diagrams from rough ideas
- **Social content** — Platform-specific posts with hooks and CTAs
- **Video briefs** — Scene-structured briefs for HeyGen avatars

Day 21 covers Kling video prompts and brings the creative toolkit together.

This is the week where you start producing things that would've taken you ages before.

---

## Week 4: Building Software

**Days 22-28** — From idea to shipped feature.

This is the spec-driven development stuff. You don't need to know how to code. You need to know how to describe what you want clearly.

The week follows a proper development cycle:

- **Day 22** — The Product Idea (Product Requirements Prompt)
- **Day 23** — The Product Backlog (prioritised in spreadsheet format)
- **Day 24** — The User Story (detailed with acceptance criteria)
- **Day 25** — Code the Story (Claude builds it from specs)
- **Day 26** — Test the Story (test suite covering all criteria)
- **Day 27** — Document the Story (README, API docs, architecture notes)
- **Day 28** — Ship It (deployed feature plus retrospective)

By Day 28, you'll have completed a full development cycle. Idea to deployed, tested, documented feature. Without writing traditional code.

The website you're reading this on was built using the same workflow you'll learn in Week 4. It works.

## Bonus: Days 29-31

**Frameworks and capstone.**

- **Day 29** — BMAD Method for planning complex projects
- **Day 30** — PRP Framework (Prompt-Response-Product pattern)
- **Day 31** — Ship It! Capstone using everything you've learned

The bonus days give you the higher-level thinking that ties it all together.

---

## What You Won't Learn

I want to be clear about what this isn't:

- Not a programming course — you won't learn Python or JavaScript
- Not computer science — no algorithms or data structures
- Not system administration — no server management
- Not machine learning theory — no neural networks or model training

This is a productivity course that uses Claude Code as the engine. If you can follow a recipe, you can follow this course.

---

## The Time Investment

Each day takes about 20-30 minutes:

- 5-10 minutes watching the video
- 15-20 minutes doing the hands-on practice

That's less than a Netflix episode. Every day for 31 days.

The learning investment is measured in hours. The time savings are measured in weeks per year.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow: **Who This Course Is For** — and honestly, who it isn't.
