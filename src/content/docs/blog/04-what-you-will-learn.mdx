## What You Won't Learn

Let's be clear about scope:

- ❌ Programming languages
- ❌ Software development
- ❌ System administration
- ❌ Machine learning theory

This isn't a coding course. It's a **productivity course** that happens to use a coding tool.

<Aside type="note">
  If you can follow a recipe, you can follow this course. The commands are provided. Your job is to
  use them.

## The Time Investment

| Component         | Time              |
| ----------------- | ----------------- |
| Daily video       | 5-10 minutes      |
| Hands-on practice | 15-20 minutes     |
| **Total per day** | **20-30 minutes** |

That's less time than a Netflix episode. Every day for a month.

## What's Next?

Tomorrow: **Who This Course Is For** — and who it definitely isn't.
