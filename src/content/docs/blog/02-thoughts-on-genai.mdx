# My Thoughts on GenAI So Far

<Badge text="Week 1" variant="note" /> <Badge text="6 min read" variant="tip" />

Two years into the AI revolution, here's what I actually think.

No hype. No doom. Just honest observations from someone who uses these tools every day.

## The Good

Let's start positive.

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Speed" icon="rocket">
    Tasks that took hours now take minutes. Not exaggerating. The 47 transcript summaries weren't a
    one-off — that's my Tuesday now.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Accessibility" icon="open-book">
    Things I couldn't do before — design, code, audio production — are now within reach. Not
    perfect, but possible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="First Drafts" icon="pencil">
    AI is brilliant at getting words on a page. The blank page problem? Solved. I edit far more than
    I write from scratch now.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Automation" icon="setting">
    Repetitive tasks can be templated and repeated. Same quality, every time, without the mental
    drain.
  </Card>

## The Bad

Now the honest bits.

### It Lies Confidently

AI doesn't know what it doesn't know. It will invent statistics, cite papers that don't exist, and state falsehoods with absolute conviction.

<Aside type="danger" title="Never trust, always verify">
  Every fact needs checking. Every citation needs confirming. Treat AI output as a first draft from
  a confident intern who means well but makes things up.
</Aside>

### The Quality Ceiling

AI can get you to 80% quickly. The last 20%? That's still on you.

For some tasks, 80% is plenty. For others, it's not even close. Knowing the difference is a skill you have to develop.

### The Homogenisation Problem

When everyone uses the same tools with the same prompts, everything starts sounding the same.

You know that AI voice:

- "In today's fast-paced world..."
- "Let's dive in..."
- "Here's the thing..."

<Card title="The antidote">
  Use AI for structure and speed, but inject your own voice in the edit. The tool is a starting
  point, not the destination.
</Card>

## The Genuinely Concerning

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Jobs">
    Some jobs will disappear. Not all. Not most. But some. The question isn't whether AI will replace you — it's whether someone using AI will.

    The response? Learn the tools. Become the person who uses AI effectively, not the person who pretends it doesn't exist.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Misinformation">
    It's now trivially easy to generate convincing fake content at scale. Fake articles. Fake reviews. Fake testimonials.

    The response? Get better at spotting AI-generated content. Verify sources obsessively. Trust less, check more.

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Dependency">
    The more I use these tools, the more I rely on them. What happens when they go down? When pricing changes? When the company pivots?

    The response? Build skills, not just workflows. Understand what the tools are doing so you could do it manually if needed.

  </TabItem>

## My Current Stack

For transparency, here's what I actually use daily:

| Tool            | Purpose              | Verdict                |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| **Claude Code** | Everything connected | Can't live without it  |
| **Claude.ai**   | Long-form thinking   | Primary reasoning tool |
| **ChatGPT**     | Quick questions      | Fast but shallow       |
| **Whisper**     | Transcription        | Best in class          |
| **ElevenLabs**  | Voice synthesis      | Eerily good            |
| **Midjourney**  | Image generation     | Improving rapidly      |

## The Bottom Line

GenAI is a power tool. Like any power tool, it can build things faster or take your fingers off.

The people winning right now are the ones who:

1. **Use it daily** — fluency comes from repetition
2. **Stay sceptical** — check everything, trust nothing
3. **Focus on output** — tools don't matter, results do
4. **Keep learning** — this space changes weekly
