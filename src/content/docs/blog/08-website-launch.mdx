## The Journey So Far

Over the past few weeks, I've shared the backstory:

- Joining the RAF at 16, travelling the world, meeting wonderful people
- The career path through Capgemini, Atos, and QA
- Teach the Nation to Code with Shafeeq — 10,000+ people across 100 countries
- Five eureka moments from GPT-3.5 to Claude Code
- Why the real opportunity is for customer-focused people who never thought they could build things themselves

CoEngineers is everything I've learned, distilled into 31 days.

## Thank You

If you've been following these posts — thank you.

If you signed up before launch — thank you.

If you're starting your first day right now — thank you.

This course exists because I believe there's a wave of people who deeply understand customer problems but have never had the tools to act on that understanding directly. Claude Code changes that.

Teach the Nation to Code was built on the belief that technology should be accessible to everyone, not just specialists. CoEngineers is the next chapter. Same philosophy, different tools.

The AI community and the learning community is genuinely an absolute treasure. There's so much good work being done by people trying to help others. I'm grateful to be part of it.
