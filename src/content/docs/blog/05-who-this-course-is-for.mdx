This course isn't for everyone. Here's how to know if it's for you.

## The People I Built This For

The people who benefit most from Claude Code aren't developers. Developers already have their workflows.

It's customer-facing people who really understand requirements but never thought they could build things themselves. Product managers, consultants, content creators, knowledge workers. People who know exactly what needs to happen but spend too much time on the tedious work to make it happen.

That's who I'm building this for. Someone who's really customer focused but never thought they could code.

## You're Probably Right For This If...

**You're drowning in content.** Meeting notes pile up. Voice memos never get processed. PDFs sit in folders you'll "get to later." Important stuff falls through cracks because there's just too much of it.

**You create regularly.** Blogs, newsletters, presentations, proposals — you produce content but spend more time on the assembly than the actual thinking.

**You understand customer problems deeply.** You know what needs to be built. You've just never had the tools to build it yourself without relying on developers or spending weeks on manual work.

**You care about results, not tools.** You're not interested in AI for its own sake. If something saves time and produces quality, you'll use it. If it doesn't, you won't.

---

## Real Examples

**The consultant** who has 15 client meetings a week. Each one generates notes they never have time to process properly. By month three, they've forgotten what they discussed in month one.

After this course: Every meeting becomes structured notes, action items, and searchable records. Automatically.

**The content creator** who spends Monday brainstorming, Tuesday outlining, Wednesday writing, Thursday editing, Friday formatting. One piece of content takes a week.

After this course: Voice memo to structured draft to formatted post. One afternoon.

**The product manager** who sits between customers and developers. They understand what needs to be built better than anyone but translating that into action takes forever.

After this course: Spec-driven development. Requirements become working features without learning to code.

**The knowledge worker** who reads constantly but retains nothing. Notes scattered across five apps. Can never find what they need when they need it.

After this course: One system. Everything connected. Searchable, organised, useful.

## Who This Isn't For

**Developers.** If you already code, this is too basic. You'll be frustrated by the pace. Go read the Claude Code docs directly — you don't need hand-holding.

**Theory seekers.** Every lesson has hands-on work. If you want to understand AI conceptually without building anything, this isn't it.

**People who need perfect first time.** AI outputs need editing. The 80% ceiling is real. If you can't accept "good enough" as a starting point, you'll fight the tools instead of using them.

**Quick fix hunters.** This is 31 days of building skills. Not a magic wand. The payoff is real but requires showing up consistently.

## The Teach the Nation Philosophy

I spent years with Teach the Nation to Code helping people who thought technology wasn't for them. Over 10,000 people across 100 countries. Most of them had never written a line of code and never thought of themselves as technical.

The approach that worked was always the same:

- Meet people where they are, not where you wish they were
- Focus on practical outcomes, not theoretical understanding
- Build confidence through small wins before tackling big challenges
- Make it accessible without dumbing it down

That's what CoEngineers is built on. Same philosophy, different tools.

<Aside type="note" title="The real question">
If someone told you "tech isn't for me" three years ago, and now they're building automations — that's the outcome I'm going for. Not turning people into developers. Showing them the door was never as closed as they thought.

## Technical Requirements

You don't need to be technical. But you do need:

- A Mac or Windows computer (reasonably modern)
- Stable internet for the videos
- Basic typing ability
- Willingness to learn something new

That's it. No terminal experience needed — we cover that in Week 1. No coding background. No prior AI experience.

## The Mindset That Works

People who succeed in this course:

1. **Show up daily** — 20-30 minutes, every day, for 31 days
2. **Do the exercises** — watching isn't enough, you have to practice
3. **Accept imperfection** — first attempts will be rough, that's normal
4. **Apply immediately** — use new skills on real work, not just examples
5. **Ask questions** — the community exists for support

---

## Quick Check

Answer honestly:

- Do you regularly feel overwhelmed by information?
- Do you spend too much time on repetitive tasks?
- Do you create content but hate the production process?
- Do you understand customer requirements better than you can execute on them?
- Can you commit 30 minutes daily for a month?

Three or more? This course is probably for you.

Less than that? Might not be the right fit — and that's fine.
