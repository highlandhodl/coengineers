This course isn't for everyone. Here's how to know if it's for you.

## The Ideal Student

You're perfect for this course if you:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Drown in content" icon="warning">
    Meeting notes, voice memos, PDFs, transcripts — you have more input than you can process. Things
    fall through cracks. Important stuff gets lost.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create regularly" icon="pencil">
    Blogs, newsletters, presentations, proposals — you produce content but spend more time
    formatting than thinking.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Work solo or small team" icon="seti:config">
    You can't hire specialists for every task. You need to do design, writing, research, and
    production yourself.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Value time over perfection" icon="approve-check">
    80% done today beats 100% done never. You need practical solutions, not theoretical frameworks.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Real People This Course Helps

### The Consultant

> "I have 15 client meetings a week. Each one generates notes I never have time to process. By Month 3, I've forgotten what we discussed in Month 1."

**After this course**: Every meeting becomes structured notes, action items, and searchable records. Automatically.

### The Content Creator

> "I spend Monday brainstorming, Tuesday outlining, Wednesday writing, Thursday editing, and Friday formatting. One piece of content takes a week."

**After this course**: Voice memo → structured draft → formatted post. One afternoon.

### The Small Business Owner

> "I need proposals, case studies, newsletters, and social posts. I can't afford a content team. So nothing gets done."

**After this course**: Templates that generate professional documents from your rough notes. No team required.

### The Knowledge Worker

> "I read constantly but retain nothing. My notes are scattered across five apps. I can never find what I need when I need it."

**After this course**: One system. Everything connected. Searchable, organised, useful.

## Who This Course Isn't For

Let's save you time if this isn't right:

<Card title="Developers" icon="error">
  If you already code, this is too basic. You'll be frustrated by the pace. Go read the Claude Code
  docs directly.
</Card>

<Card title="Theory Seekers" icon="error">
  Every lesson has hands-on work. If you want to understand AI conceptually without doing anything,
  this isn't it.
</Card>

<Card title="Perfectionists" icon="error">
  AI outputs need editing. If you can't accept "good enough" as a starting point, you'll fight the
  tools instead of using them.
</Card>

<Card title="Quick Fix Hunters" icon="error">
  This is 31 days of building skills. Not a magic wand. The payoff is real but requires showing up.
</Card>

## The Technical Requirements

<Aside type="note" title="You don't need to be technical">
  But you do need to be willing to learn a few new things.
</Aside>

| Requirement   | Level Needed                      |

| Internet      | Stable connection for video       |
| Typing        | Basic keyboard proficiency        |
| Terminal      | None — we teach this in Week 1    |
| Coding        | None — this isn't a coding course |
| AI Experience | None — we start from scratch      |
