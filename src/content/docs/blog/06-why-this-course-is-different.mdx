# Why This Course Is Different

<Badge text="Week 2" variant="note" /> <Badge text="5 min read" variant="tip" />

There are hundreds of AI courses. Most are rubbish. Here's why this one isn't.

## The Problem With AI Courses

Most AI education follows the same pattern:

1. **Theory dump** — 4 hours explaining what a large language model is
2. **Generic demos** — "look, I asked ChatGPT to write a poem!"
3. **No real workflow** — disconnected tips that don't connect
4. **Already outdated** — tools changed since the course was recorded

You finish knowing _about_ AI but not how to _use_ it.

<Aside type="caution">
  If a course spends more time on theory than practice, it's a lecture, not training.
</Aside>

## How This Course Is Different

### 1. Built With The Tool It Teaches

This entire course was created using Claude Code.

- **The website** — generated with Claude Code
- **The slash commands** — written with Claude Code
- **The video scripts** — drafted with Claude Code
- **The marketing posts** — yes, including this one

<Card title="Proof, not promises">
  Every technique we teach has been tested by building this course with it. If it's in the
  curriculum, it works.
</Card>

### 2. Practical From Day One

No theory weeks. No "getting started" purgatory.

<Steps>
  1. Day 1 — Install Claude Code 2. Day 1 — Run your first slash command 3. Day 1 — See actual
  output
</Steps>

You produce something useful on the first day. And every day after.

### 3. The Slash Command System

Every lesson comes with a ready-to-use command:

```bash
/w1.d1  # Week 1, Day 1
/w2.d10 # Week 2, Day 10
```

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="No typing prompts" icon="approve-check">
    Copy the command. Run it. Done.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Consistent results" icon="approve-check">
    Same command, same output. Reliable every time.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Reusable forever" icon="approve-check">
    Commands stay in your setup. Use them long after the course ends.
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### 4. Real Workflows, Not Demos

Other courses show isolated tricks:

- "Here's how to summarise text"
- "Here's how to write an email"
- "Here's how to generate an image"

This course shows **connected workflows**:

```
Voice Memo → Transcript → Structured Notes → Blog Draft → Social Threads
```

One input. Multiple outputs. All automated.

### 5. Non-Developer Focus

Most Claude Code content assumes you can code.

We don't.

| What Developers See | What You'll See     |
| ------------------- | ------------------- |
| API documentation   | Step-by-step videos |
| Code snippets       | Copy-paste commands |
| "Just use Python"   | "Run this command"  |
| Terminal assumed    | Terminal explained  |

## What Makes The Difference

| Other Courses  | This Course          |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| Theory-heavy   | Practice-first       |
| Isolated tips  | Connected workflows  |
| Assumes coding | Assumes nothing      |
| Static content | Living commands      |
| One-way videos | Community support    |
| Generic tools  | Claude Code specific |

## The Meta Point

Here's the thing: this course is its own proof of concept.

Every asset you're looking at — the website, the content, the marketing — was created using the exact workflows taught in the course.

If the course works well enough to build itself, it'll work for you too.
