There are loads of AI courses out there. Most follow the same pattern. This one doesn't.

## The Problem With Most AI Education

Most AI courses I've seen look like this:

- Four hours explaining what a large language model is
- Generic demos that show off features but don't solve real problems
- Disconnected tips that never come together into actual workflows
- Content that was already outdated by the time it was published

You finish knowing *about* AI but not how to actually *use* it. That's a waste of everyone's time.

## How This Is Different

### Built with the tool it teaches

This entire course was created using Claude Code.

The website you're reading? Built with Claude Code. The slash commands you'll download? Written with Claude Code. The video scripts? Drafted with Claude Code. The blog posts, including this one? Claude Code.

I'm not teaching theoretical workflows. I'm teaching the exact ones I used to build what you're looking at.

If a technique is in the curriculum, it's because I've actually used it. Proof, not promises.

### Practical from day one

No theory weeks. No "getting started" purgatory.

Day 1: Install Claude Code. Run your first command. See actual output.

You produce something useful on the first day. And every day after.

### The slash command system

Every lesson comes with a ready-to-use command:

```bash
/w1.d1  # Week 1, Day 1
/w2.d8  # Week 2, Day 8
```

You're not typing prompts from scratch. The commands are pre-built. Run them and see results. Same command, same quality output. Reliable every time.

And they stay with you after the course ends. These aren't training wheels — they're tools you'll keep using.

### Real workflows, not demos

Other courses show isolated tricks. "Here's how to summarise text." "Here's how to write an email."

This course shows connected workflows:

```
Voice Memo → Transcript → Structured Notes → Blog Draft → Social Threads
```

One input. Multiple outputs. All automated. That's how real productivity works.

### Non-developer focus

Most Claude Code content assumes you can code. This course doesn't.

What developers see: API documentation, code snippets, "just use Python."

What you'll see: Step-by-step videos, copy-paste commands, terminal explained from scratch.

I'm not expecting you to become a developer. I'm expecting you to use a tool effectively.

### Spec-driven development

Week 4 teaches you to build software without traditional coding. The Speckit approach:

1. **Specify** — Define what you want in plain language
2. **Clarify** — Claude asks questions to fill gaps
3. **Plan** — Technical design decisions get made
4. **Tasks** — Break down into executable steps
5. **Implement** — Claude builds it

This is how I built this course website. This is how you'll build your own tools.

### Teach the Nation DNA

I spent years at QA and with Teach the Nation to Code learning how to make complex technology accessible. Over 10,000 people across 100 countries. People who thought tech wasn't for them.

The teaching approach is tested:

- Start where people actually are
- Focus on practical outcomes
- Build confidence through small wins
- Make it accessible without dumbing it down

That DNA runs through every lesson.

## What You Get

- **31 videos** — 5-10 minutes each, no fluff
- **28 slash commands** — Pre-built automations, download and use immediately
- **Example files** — Real inputs and outputs for every lesson
- **Community access** — Ask questions, share wins, get unstuck

## The Meta Point

This course is its own proof of concept.

Every asset you're looking at — the website, the content, the slash commands, the marketing — was created using the exact workflows taught in the course.

If the methodology works well enough to build itself, it'll work for you too.

<Aside type="note" title="Eating my own cooking">
I'm genuinely using these tools every day. The course isn't based on what I think might work — it's based on what I know works because I'm living it.
