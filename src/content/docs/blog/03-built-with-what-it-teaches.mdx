title: Built With What It Teaches

Most AI courses teach you about tools. This one was built with them.

The website you're reading this on? Claude Code. The curriculum structure? Claude Code. The slash commands you'll download? Claude Code. This blog post? Claude Code.

That's not a gimmick. That's the point.

## The Proof

A few weeks ago, I needed to build an AI maturity assessment tool. Not a prototype — a working application that real users would interact with.

Four hours later, it was live.

Same process. Spec-driven development. Clear requirements in, working software out.

I'm not a faster developer than I was a year ago. The tools changed. And more importantly, I learned how to use them properly.

## What This Actually Looks Like

Here's the process that built this course:

**The site architecture** — I described what I wanted. A documentation site with weekly modules, daily lessons, downloadable commands. Claude Code scaffolded the whole thing.

**The curriculum** — I had rough ideas for 31 days. Claude Code helped me structure them, identify gaps, ensure each day built on the last.

**The slash commands** — Every automation in the course was written, tested, and refined using Claude Code itself.

**These posts** — I speak into a voice memo, process it through a transcription command, then shape the draft with Claude Code.

The meta layer matters. If the methodology couldn't build itself, why would you trust it to build anything else?

## Not Just Claude Code

Here's something I want to be honest about: this workflow isn't magic exclusive to one tool.

The same approach works with Cursor. It works with Gemini CLI. It'll probably work with whatever comes next.

The skill is the structure. The thinking. The process of going from vague idea to clear spec to working output.

Claude Code happens to be the best tool I've found for this right now. But what you're really learning is a way of working with AI — any AI — that actually produces results.

<Aside type="note" title="Tools change. Process endures.">
In six months, the landscape will look different. The spec-driven approach will still work.

## Why This Matters For You

If you're reading this thinking "that's fine for someone technical" — go back and read post one.

I didn't start technical. I learned. And the learning curve is shorter now than it's ever been.

The four-hour assessment tool wasn't built by a developer with years of training. It was built by someone who understood what the tool needed to do and could describe it clearly.

That's the skill. Understanding requirements. Being specific about outcomes. Thinking in terms of user needs.

If you're customer-facing — if you spend your days understanding what people actually want — you already have the hard part. The rest is learnable.
