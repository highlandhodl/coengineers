# Community — Coming Soon

We're building something special for you.

The CoEngineers community will be the place to connect with fellow Claude Code enthusiasts, share your wins, get help when stuck, and learn from others on the same journey.

## What to Expect

When the community launches in **January 2026**, you'll be able to:

- **Ask questions** when you get stuck on a lesson
- **Share your automations** and get feedback
- **Connect** with other Claude Code users
- **Join live Q&A sessions** with weekly office hours
- **Access exclusive resources** and templates

## Be the First to Know

## In the Meantime

While you wait for the community:

- **[Install Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/getting-started)** — Get set up in 5 minutes
- **[Follow on LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/company/coengineers)** — Tips and updates
- **[Subscribe to YouTube](https://youtube.com/@coengineers)** — Course videos and tutorials

## Why Wait Until January?

We want to launch the community alongside the course so everyone starts together. This creates better discussions, shared momentum, and a cohort of people all learning at the same pace.

Trust us — it'll be worth the wait.
