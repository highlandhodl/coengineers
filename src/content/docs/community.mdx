- **Connect** with other Claude Code users

## Community Guidelines

We keep things simple:

1. **Be kind** — everyone's learning at their own pace
2. **Share your wins** — no matter how small
3. **Ask questions freely** — there are no stupid questions
4. **Help others** — if you know the answer, share it

## Getting Help

When asking for help, include:

- What you're trying to do
- What you've already tried
- Any error messages you're seeing
- Your operating system (Mac, Windows, Linux)

The more context you give, the faster we can help.

## Weekly Office Hours

Every week, we host a live Q&A session where you can ask questions directly.

Details posted in the community.

## See You There

The community is the best part of this course. Looking forward to seeing what you build.
