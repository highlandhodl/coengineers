# Privacy Policy

**Last updated**: 9 December 2024

CoEngineers ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy. This policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use our website at coengineers.ai.

## What Data We Collect

When you subscribe to our email list, we collect:

- **Email address** — So we can send you course updates
- **Subscription timestamp** — When you signed up
- **Source** — Which page you signed up from (e.g., homepage, community page)

That's it. We don't collect names, addresses, payment information, or any other personal data through our email signup.

## How We Use Your Data

We use your email address solely to:

- Send you notifications about the 31 Days of Claude Code course
- Inform you when the community launches
- Share occasional updates about CoEngineers

We will **never**:

- Sell your data to third parties
- Send you unrelated marketing
- Share your email with other companies for their marketing

## Third-Party Services

We use the following services to operate our email system:

| Service      | Purpose          | Data Shared                      |
| ------------ | ---------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Supabase** | Database storage | Email address, subscription data |
| **Resend**   | Email delivery   | Email address, email content     |
| **Vercel**   | Website hosting  | Standard web logs                |

Each service has their own privacy policy and handles data in accordance with GDPR requirements.

## Data Retention

We keep your email address until:

- You unsubscribe (click the link in any email)
- You request deletion (email us)
- The course is complete and you're no longer receiving emails

After unsubscribing, we retain only a record that you unsubscribed (to prevent accidentally re-adding you) but no longer send you emails.
