## What You'll Learn

- Process rambling voice memos into structured thoughts
- Extract key ideas from conversational audio
- Create different output formats (notes, tasks, ideas)
- Use Whisper for transcription (local, free)

## The Scenario

Fiona records voice memos whilst walking through the distillery. Observations about the whisky, ideas for new products, things she needs to remember. It's all in recordings on her phone - unusable until now.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d9" />

Turn rambling voice memos into organised thoughts.

### What We're Building

A system for processing voice memo transcripts into structured notes, extracting the gold from stream-of-consciousness audio.

### Understanding Voice Memo Challenges

Voice memos are different from meetings:
- Single speaker (usually)
- Stream of consciousness
- Topic jumping
- Incomplete thoughts
- Filler words and thinking pauses

### Step 1: Create the Voice Memo Processor

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process-voice-memo.md:

# Process Voice Memo

You are helping me extract structured content from a voice memo transcript.

## The Challenge
Voice memos are rambling by nature. The speaker jumps between topics, has incomplete thoughts, and mixes observations with action items.

## Your Task
From the transcript, extract:

1. **Key Topics** - What subjects were mentioned?
2. **Observations** - Facts, notices, things seen/heard
3. **Ideas** - Suggestions, possibilities, creative thoughts
4. **Action Items** - Things to do, people to contact, tasks
5. **Questions** - Things to figure out, uncertainties
6. **Random Notes** - Anything else worth capturing

## Output Format
Create sections for each category. Only include sections that have content. Be concise - voice memos have lots of filler.

Use British English. Date the output."

### Step 2: Process Fiona's Voice Memo

Here's a sample voice memo transcript:

"Process this voice memo transcript:

```
so i'm walking past the warehouse and cask 47 is definitely
leaking a wee bit, not urgent but hamish should check it
this week... um... what else... oh the Henderson order, did
we confirm that, i need to check with sarah... thinking about
the christmas event again, what if we did whisky and chocolate
pairings, could be something different... the barley delivery
is tuesday i think, need to be here for that... hmm that new
recipe jamie mentioned for the gin, worth exploring, maybe
spring launch... the website really does need updating, saw
a competitor's site yesterday and ours looks ancient...
oh and call duncan about barley prices going up, he mentioned
something at the pub... remind me to check the fermentation
temps this afternoon...
```

Save to week-2-outputs/fiona-voice-memo-processed.md"

### Step 3: Create Different Output Modes

Sometimes you want different formats:

"Create two more slash commands:
1. process-voice-ideas.md - Only extract ideas and creative thoughts
2. process-voice-actions.md - Only extract action items as a task list"

### Step 4: Batch Process

If you have multiple voice memos:

"Look in [YOUR FOLDER] for any .txt files that look like voice memo transcripts. List them and ask which ones I want to process."

### Sample Voice Memos for Practice

**Voice Memo 2 - Jamie thinking about social media:**
```
okay so social media plan for december... instagram definitely,
we should show the casks, people love that behind the scenes
stuff... maybe a countdown to christmas, like 12 drams of
christmas or something cheesy like that... need to ask fiona
about budget for promoted posts... should we do tiktok,
probably not our demographic but maybe... the competitor in
islay is doing really well on linkedin actually, b2b angle,
we should try that for trade customers... oh remind me to
get photos of the new batch, the colour is really good...
```

### Your Turn

Record a voice memo of yourself thinking about a project. Transcribe it (use Whisper or any tool). Process it with your new command. See what Claude extracts.

## What You Learned

- Voice memos need different processing than meetings
- Multiple output formats serve different purposes
- The "action items only" filter is powerful
- Whisper + Claude = free voice-to-structured-notes

## Prerequisites

- Whisper installed locally (free, runs on your machine)
- Or: Use a transcription service of your choice

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process-voice-memo.md`
- `.claude/commands/process-voice-ideas.md`
- `.claude/commands/process-voice-actions.md`
- Processed voice memo with structured output

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 10: YouTube Brain](/week-2/day-10-youtube-brain/), we'll extract insights from videos.
