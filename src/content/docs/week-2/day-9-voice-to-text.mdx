## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d9" label="Process voice memos" />

## What You'll Learn

- Transform raw voice transcriptions into polished written content
- Remove filler words and false starts whilst preserving meaning
- Restructure rambling thoughts into clear paragraphs
- Maintain the speaker's voice and intent during cleanup

## The Scenario

Fiona records voice memos whilst walking through the distillery. Observations about the whisky, ideas for new products, things she needs to remember. It's all in recordings on her phone - unusable until now.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                  | Description                                                       |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cleanup Levels**       | Light, medium, or heavy polish depending on purpose               |
| **Meaning Preservation** | Keep the speaker's intent whilst removing verbal clutter          |
| **Output Modes**         | Full processing, just ideas, or just actions                      |
| **Natural Voice**        | Personal notes vs professional documents need different treatment |

## What You'll Create

- Polished text from stream-of-consciousness recordings
- Action-only extractions from rambling memos
- Idea lists from brainstorming sessions
- Multiple output formats from the same input

## Quick Reference

- Voice memos need different handling than written notes
- Choose cleanup level based on your purpose
- Don't clean up the transcript first - let Claude handle it
- Try Whisper for free local transcription
