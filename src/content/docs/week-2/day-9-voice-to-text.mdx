## What You'll Learn

- Process rambling voice memos into structured thoughts
- Extract key ideas from conversational audio
- Create different output formats (notes, tasks, ideas)
- Use Whisper for transcription (local, free)

## The Scenario

Fiona records voice memos whilst walking through the distillery. Observations about the whisky, ideas for new products, things she needs to remember. It's all in recordings on her phone - unusable until now.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d9" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to extract structured content from voice memo transcripts.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks for the transcript** - Voice memos are messy, that's OK
2. **Understands context** - When/where recorded, what prompted it
3. **Identifies your goal** - Full extraction, just ideas, or just actions?
4. **Extracts the gold** - From stream-of-consciousness to structure
5. **Creates appropriate output** - Based on what you needed

### Voice Memo Challenges

Voice memos are different from meetings:
- Single speaker (usually)
- Stream of consciousness
- Topic jumping
- Incomplete thoughts
- Filler words and thinking pauses

The command handles all of this.

## Example Output

Based on your needs:
- **Full processing**: Ideas, observations, actions, everything
- **Just ideas**: Creative thoughts extracted
- **Just actions**: Task list ready to do
- **Quick summary**: 5 bullet points, done

## Tips for Success

- **Share the context** - Where were you? What prompted this?
- **Don't clean up the transcript** - Messy is fine
- **Choose your output mode** - Different needs, different formats
- **Try Whisper** - Free local transcription

## What You Learned

- Voice memos need different processing than meetings
- Multiple output formats serve different purposes
- The "action items only" filter is powerful
- Whisper + Claude = free voice-to-structured-notes

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 10: YouTube Brain](/week-2/day-10-youtube-brain/), we'll extract insights from videos.
