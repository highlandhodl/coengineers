## What You'll Learn

- Review and consolidate Week 2 skills
- Build a unified "content processing pipeline"
- Create a master processor command
- Prepare for Week 3

## The Scenario

Jamie now has six processing commands. But they're separate. What if one command could route to the right processor automatically?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d14" />

Build your unified content processing pipeline.

### What We're Building

A master processor that routes content to the right handler automatically, plus a Week 2 retrospective.

## This Week You Built

| Day | Command | Processes |
|-----|---------|-----------|
| 8 | `/process-meeting` | Meeting transcripts |
| 9 | `/process-voice-memo` | Voice recordings |
| 10 | `/process-youtube` | Video transcripts |
| 11 | `/process-pdf` | PDF documents |
| 12 | `/archive-webpage` | Web articles |
| 13 | `/process-email` | Email threads |

### Step 1: Create the Master Processor

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process.md:

# Process Content

You are my content processing assistant.

## What I'll Give You
Any type of content:
- Meeting transcript
- Voice memo transcript
- YouTube video transcript
- PDF file path
- Web URL
- Email thread

## Your Task
1. Identify what type of content this is
2. Apply the appropriate processing approach:
   - Meetings → speakers, decisions, actions
   - Voice memos → ideas, observations, actions
   - YouTube → summary, key points, quotes
   - PDFs → summary, data extraction
   - Web → clean archive with metadata
   - Email → decisions, actions, follow-ups
3. Ask me where to save the output
4. Suggest what to do next

## Intelligence
- Infer content type from context
- Ask if you're not sure
- Combine approaches if content is mixed"

### Step 2: Test the Master Processor

Try it with different content types:

"Here's some content to process:

[PASTE ANY CONTENT TYPE]

Process it appropriately."

### Step 3: Review Your Commands

"List all the slash commands I created during Week 2. For each:
- Show the file path
- One-line description
- Count how many times I might have used it"

### Step 4: Create Week 2 Retrospective

"Create a retrospective at 01-projects/learning-claude-code/week-2-retro.md with:
- Frontmatter: date, week: 2
- What I processed this week
- Which command I'll use most
- What I want to refine
- Ideas for new processors"

### Step 5: Prepare for Week 3

Week 3 is about creative outputs - using your processed content to generate new assets.

"Review my 03-resources folder. What content do I have that could be turned into:
- A presentation
- Social media posts
- Visual content
- Audio/video scripts

Give me 3 specific suggestions for Week 3."

## The Content Processing Pipeline

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              INPUTS                             │
│  Meetings  Voice  YouTube  PDF  Web  Email     │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       ↓
┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
│              /process                           │
│         (auto-routes to right handler)          │
└──────────────────────┬──────────────────────────┘
                       ↓
┌──────────────────────┴──────────────────────────┐
│              OUTPUTS                            │
│  Structured notes in your vault                 │
│  Ready for Week 3 creative transformation       │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Your Turn

Process 3 different types of content through your master processor. Verify each works correctly.

## What You Learned This Week

| Day | Skill | Superpower |
|-----|-------|------------|
| 8 | Meeting processing | 47 mins → 2 min summary |
| 9 | Voice memos | Rambling → organised |
| 10 | YouTube | Hours watched → notes kept |
| 11 | PDFs | Locked info → liberated |
| 12 | Web articles | Bookmarks → archives |
| 13 | Email | Chaos → action items |
| 14 | Pipeline | One command, any content |

## Ready for Week 3?

Week 3: Creative Outputs - From notes to assets that impress

We'll generate:
- Presentations (Gamma)
- Images (Gemini)
- Audio scripts (ElevenLabs)
- Diagrams (Mermaid)
- Social content
- Video briefs (HeyGen, Kling)

Run `/w3.d15` when you're ready!

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process.md` (master router)
- `week-2-retro.md`
- Verified processing pipeline
