description: 'Transform messy inputs into structured, actionable outputs'
---

**Theme:** "From chaos to clarity in seconds."

This week, you'll build your content ingestion pipeline. By the end, you'll have tools to handle any input format and output consistent, structured notes.

## What You'll Learn

- Process meeting transcripts into structured action items
- Transform voice memo transcripts into organised thoughts
- Extract insights from YouTube videos
- Summarise and extract data from PDF documents
- Archive web articles as clean, permanent markdown
- Turn email threads into actionable next steps

## Thistle & Thorn Context

The distillery has a backlog of content that's never been organised:

- Fiona's voice memos about whisky production
- Meeting recordings from distributor calls
- PDFs of industry reports
- Saved web articles about whisky trends
- Email threads with suppliers

Jamie's mission: process it all into usable knowledge.
