# Week 2: Content Processing

**Theme:** "From chaos to clarity in seconds."

This week, we build your content ingestion pipeline. By the end, you'll have tools to handle any input format and output consistent, structured notes.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of Week 2, you'll be able to:

1. Process meeting transcripts into structured notes
2. Transform voice memo transcripts into organised thoughts
3. Extract insights from YouTube videos
4. Rip key data from PDF documents
5. Archive web articles as clean markdown
6. Turn email threads into action items
7. Build a personal "content processing pipeline"

## Week 2 Outcome

A suite of content ingestion tools that handle any input format and output consistent, structured notes.

## Thistle & Thorn Context

The distillery has a backlog of content that's never been organised:
- Fiona's voice memos about whisky production
- Meeting recordings from distributor calls
- PDFs of industry reports
- Saved web articles about whisky trends
- Email threads with suppliers

Jamie's mission: process it all into usable knowledge.
