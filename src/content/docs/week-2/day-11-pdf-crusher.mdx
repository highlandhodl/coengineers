## What You'll Learn

- Extract text and data from PDF documents
- Handle different PDF types (text, scanned, tables)
- Create markdown summaries from reports
- Extract specific data points

## The Scenario

Fiona receives industry reports, supplier price lists, and regulatory documents - all as PDFs. The information is locked in. Time to unlock it.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d11" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to extract what you need from PDF documents.

### What the Command Does

1. **Gets the PDF** - File path or description
2. **Identifies the type** - Report, form, data sheet, manual?
3. **Understands your goal** - Summary, specific data, or conversion?
4. **Processes appropriately** - Different PDFs need different approaches
5. **Creates useful output** - Ready to use

### What Claude Can Do with PDFs

- **Read and summarise** - Extract key points
- **Find specific information** - Answer targeted questions
- **Extract tables** - Convert to markdown tables
- **Pull quotes** - With page references
- **Convert to markdown** - Make content editable

## Example Output

Depending on your needs:
- **Full summary**: Key findings, implications, action items
- **Data extraction**: Tables, figures, statistics
- **Q&A**: Direct answers with page references
- **Markdown conversion**: Editable document

## Tips for Success

- **Know what you need** - Summary vs specific data
- **Provide context** - Why are you reading this PDF?
- **Ask follow-up questions** - Claude can dig deeper
- **Save tables as markdown** - Much more useful than PDFs

## What You Learned

- Claude Code reads PDFs natively
- Summaries beat re-reading 40-page documents
- Tables can be extracted as markdown
- Targeted extraction for specific data

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 12: Web Archiver](/week-2/day-12-web-archiver/), we'll save articles as clean markdown.
