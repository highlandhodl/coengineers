## What You'll Learn

- Extract text and data from PDF documents
- Handle different PDF types (text, scanned, tables)
- Create markdown summaries from reports
- Extract specific data points

## The Scenario

Fiona receives industry reports, supplier price lists, and regulatory documents - all as PDFs. The information is locked in. Time to unlock it.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d11" />

Liberate information locked in PDF documents.

### What We're Building

A system for extracting insights, data, and summaries from PDF reports and documents.

### The Challenge

The Scotch Whisky Association sends quarterly industry reports. 40 pages of PDF. Fiona needs to know the three things that affect Thistle & Thorn. Let's find them.

### Claude Code and PDFs

Claude Code can read PDF files directly. Just point it at the file and ask questions.

### Step 1: Create the PDF Processor

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process-pdf.md:

# Process PDF Document

You are helping me extract key information from a PDF document.

## Input
I'll provide a path to a PDF file.

## Your Task
1. Read the PDF content
2. Identify what type of document it is
3. Create a summary with:
   - Document title and source
   - Date/version
   - Key findings (bullet points)
   - Any tables or data as markdown tables
   - Action items or implications
   - Notable quotes

## Output Format
Markdown file with frontmatter including source file path.
Preserve important data, discard boilerplate.

If there are tables, convert them to markdown format."

### Step 2: Process a Sample PDF

Let's process an industry report:

"Read the PDF at [PATH TO SAMPLE PDF] and:
1. Tell me what type of document it is
2. Summarise the key points relevant to a craft distillery
3. Extract any statistics or data tables
4. Save the summary to week-2-outputs/industry-report-summary.md"

### Step 3: Targeted Extraction

Sometimes you need specific data:

"Create a slash command process-pdf-data.md that:
- Asks what specific data I'm looking for
- Searches the PDF for relevant sections
- Extracts only the requested information
- Outputs as a focused brief"

### Step 4: Handle Tables

PDF tables are tricky. Practise extracting them:

"If the PDF has any tables:
1. Identify all tables in the document
2. Convert the most relevant table to markdown format
3. Explain what the table shows"

### Step 5: Build a Reports Library

"Create a folder at 03-resources/reports/ for processed PDF summaries. Add a README explaining the structure."

### Sample PDF Types to Practise

If you don't have PDFs handy, try:
- Any industry report (Google "[your industry] report 2024 pdf")
- A user manual for software you use
- A research paper from Google Scholar
- A government publication

### Your Turn

Find a PDF relevant to your work. Process it with your new command. Extract at least one table or data set.

## What You Learned

- Claude Code reads PDFs natively
- Summaries beat re-reading 40-page documents
- Tables can be extracted as markdown
- Targeted extraction for specific data

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process-pdf.md`
- `.claude/commands/process-pdf-data.md`
- `industry-report-summary.md`
- Reports folder setup

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 12: Web Archiver](/week-2/day-12-web-archiver/), we'll save articles as clean markdown.
