## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d11" label="Process PDF documents" />

## What You'll Learn

- Extract key information from long reports or documents
- Summarise research papers and technical documentation
- Create executive summaries from detailed documents
- Answer specific questions about document content

## The Scenario

Fiona receives industry reports, supplier price lists, and regulatory documents - all as PDFs. The information is locked in. Time to unlock it.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                       | Description                                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Document Types**            | Different approaches for research papers, business reports, technical specs |
| **Executive Summaries**       | Extract objectives, findings, recommendations, and risks                    |
| **Question-Based Extraction** | Ask targeted questions instead of reading everything                        |
| **Data Liberation**           | Extract tables and metrics into structured formats                          |

## What You'll Create

- One-page executive summaries from lengthy reports
- Targeted answers to specific document questions
- Comparison tables from multiple vendor proposals
- Extracted data tables from scattered metrics

## Quick Reference
