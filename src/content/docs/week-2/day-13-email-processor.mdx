## The Scenario

Fiona's inbox is chaos. Buried in a 47-email thread with a supplier are three critical things she needs to do. Let's find them.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d13" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to extract clarity from email chaos.

### What the Command Does

1. **Gets the email thread** - Paste or describe
2. **Identifies participants** - Who's involved and their role
3. **Chooses output mode** - Full processing, just actions, or draft reply
4. **Flags urgency** - Any deadlines to highlight
5. **Creates actionable output** - Ready to use

### What You'll Extract

- **Thread overview** - What's this about?
- **Key decisions** - What was agreed
- **Action items** - Who does what, by when
- **Open questions** - What's still unresolved
- **Follow-up needed** - What you need to do

## Example Output

**Full Processing**:
- Thread summary
- Decision table
- Action items table
- Open questions
- Draft response (if needed)

**Just Actions**:
- My actions
- Waiting on others
- Key decisions

## Tips for Success

- **Include the whole thread** - Context matters
- **Identify relationships** - Client, colleague, boss affects tone
- **Flag urgency** - Deadlines get highlighted
- **Consider privacy** - Remove sensitive details if sharing

## What You Learned

- Email threads hide important information
- Structured extraction reveals actions
- Multiple participants = multiple action owners
- Quick action mode for busy days

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 14: Week 2 Review](/week-2/day-14-week-2-review/), we'll build your processing pipeline.
