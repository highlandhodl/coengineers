## What You'll Learn

- Process email threads to extract action items
- Summarise long email conversations
- Identify decisions and next steps
- Create follow-up tasks from emails

## The Scenario

Fiona's inbox is chaos. Buried in a 47-email thread with a supplier are three critical things she needs to do. Let's find them.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d13" />

Extract action items and clarity from email chaos.

### What We're Building

A system for processing email threads into clear summaries, decisions, and action items.

### The Challenge

47 emails between Fiona, Duncan (barley supplier), and their accountant about pricing, delivery schedules, and payment terms. Somewhere in there are decisions. Let's find them.

### Step 1: Create the Email Processor

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process-email.md:

# Process Email Thread

You are helping me extract actionable information from an email thread.

## Input
I'll paste an email thread. It may include:
- Multiple participants
- Replies and forwards
- Mixed topics
- Attached file references

## Your Task
Create a structured summary with:

1. **Thread Overview**
   - Subject
   - Participants
   - Date range
   - Topic summary (1-2 sentences)

2. **Key Decisions**
   - What was agreed or decided?
   - Who agreed to it?

3. **Action Items**
   Table: Action | Owner | Due Date | Context

4. **Open Questions**
   - What's still unresolved?
   - Who needs to respond?

5. **Attachments/References**
   - Files mentioned
   - Links shared

6. **Follow-up Required**
   - What should I do next?
   - Draft a response if needed

## Output Format
Clean markdown. Focus on actionable content."

### Step 2: Process a Sample Thread

Here's a sample email thread:

"Process this email thread:

```
From: Duncan <duncan@highland-barley.co.uk>
To: Fiona <fiona@thistle-thorn.com>
Subject: RE: RE: RE: Barley order Q1 2025

Fiona,

Following up on our call. I can confirm:
- 500kg at £2.10/kg for January delivery
- Same terms as last year
- Let me know by Dec 15 if you want the February option too

Need the PO number when you get a chance.

Duncan

CC: sarah@thistle-thorn.com

Duncan,

Thanks. Can you also quote for 750kg in February? We might
need extra if the Christmas sales go well.

Sarah - can you send Duncan the PO number for January?

Fiona

Hi Duncan,

PO number is TT-2025-0012.

Payment terms: net 30 as usual?

Sarah
```

Save to week-2-outputs/barley-supplier-thread.md"

### Step 3: Quick Actions Mode

Sometimes you just want the tasks:

"Create a slash command process-email-actions.md that ONLY outputs:
- Action items as a checklist
- With owners and due dates
- Nothing else"

### Step 4: Response Drafting

Add the ability to draft responses:

"Update process-email.md to include a section that drafts a suggested response if one is needed. Mark it as 'Draft Response (review before sending)'."

### Privacy Note

When processing emails, consider privacy:
- Remove sensitive information if sharing
- Process locally when possible
- Be mindful of confidential content

### Your Turn

Find an email thread that has buried action items. Process it and extract the tasks. How many did you find that you'd forgotten about?

## What You Learned

- Email threads hide important information
- Structured extraction reveals actions
- Multiple participants = multiple action owners
- Quick action mode for busy days

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process-email.md`
- `.claude/commands/process-email-actions.md`
- `barley-supplier-thread.md` with extracted actions

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 14: Week 2 Review](/week-2/day-14-week-2-review/), we'll build your processing pipeline.
