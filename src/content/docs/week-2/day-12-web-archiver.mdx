## What You'll Learn

- Fetch and clean web page content
- Strip ads, navigation, and clutter
- Save articles as clean markdown
- Build an article archive

## The Scenario

Jamie bookmarks interesting articles. The bookmarks pile up. Links break. Paywalls appear. Time to archive properly.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d12" />

Save web articles as clean, permanent markdown.

### What We're Building

An archiving system that captures web articles in clean markdown with metadata, notes, and proper organisation.

### The Challenge

Jamie finds a brilliant article on whisky tourism trends. Six months from now they'll want to reference it. But will the link still work? Will it be paywalled? Archive it now.

### Step 1: Create the Web Archiver

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/archive-webpage.md:

# Archive Web Page

You are helping me save a web article as clean markdown.

## Input
I'll provide a URL.

## Your Task
1. Fetch the page content
2. Extract the main article content
3. Remove: ads, navigation, sidebars, footers, popups
4. Convert to clean markdown
5. Add frontmatter:
   - title
   - source (domain)
   - url
   - date-archived: today
   - tags (suggest based on content)
6. Preserve:
   - Headings structure
   - Key images (as markdown image links)
   - Important links
   - Author and date if available

## Output Format
Clean markdown with frontmatter. Reading-focused."

### Step 2: Archive a Sample Article

Let's archive something relevant:

"Archive this URL: [RELEVANT URL]

Save to 03-resources/articles/ with a slug-based filename."

### Step 3: Add Personal Notes

Make archived articles more useful:

"Update archive-webpage.md to also include:
- A 'My Notes' section at the end for personal annotations
- A 'Why I Saved This' prompt I should fill in
- A 'Key Quotes' section with 2-3 notable quotes"

### Step 4: Batch Archive

Sometimes you have a list of URLs:

"I'll give you a list of URLs. For each one, tell me the title and ask if I want to archive it. Then process the ones I approve."

### Step 5: Organise by Topic

"In my articles folder, create subfolders:
- marketing
- industry
- operations
- reference

Move any archived articles to appropriate subfolders."

### Good Sources to Archive

For practice, try archiving:
- A blog post you want to remember
- A how-to article for a tool you use
- An industry news piece
- A recipe or guide

### Your Turn

Archive 3 articles you've been meaning to save. Add personal notes to each. Organise by topic.

## What You Learned

- Web content is ephemeral - archive what matters
- Clean markdown beats cluttered bookmarks
- Personal notes add context for future you
- Organisation makes retrieval easy

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/archive-webpage.md`
- Archived articles with clean formatting
- Articles folder with topic subfolders

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 13: Email Processor](/week-2/day-13-email-processor/), we'll turn threads into action items.
