import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w2.d12" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d12" label="Archive web content" />

## What You'll Learn

- Extract key insights from web articles and blog posts
- Organise web content into searchable personal knowledge bases
- Summarise technical documentation for future reference
- Create reading notes that are actually useful later

## The Scenario

Jamie bookmarks interesting articles. The bookmarks pile up. Links break. Paywalls appear. Time to archive properly.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                    | Description                                            |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Bookmarks vs Knowledge** | Save insights, not just locations                      |
| **Content Types**          | Different structures for tutorials, opinions, and news |
| **Personal Wiki Pattern**  | Connected notes that build knowledge over time         |
| **Multi-Source Synthesis** | Combine insights from multiple articles                |

## What You'll Create

- Structured reading notes with insights and actions
- Personal wiki entries with tags and connections
- Research syntheses from multiple sources
- Archive notes that actually get used later

## Quick Reference

- Process content when you find it, don't just bookmark
- Extract insights, actions, and connections - not just summaries
- Adapt structure to content type and purpose
- Use consistent tags for finding notes later
