## What You'll Learn

- Fetch and clean web page content
- Strip ads, navigation, and clutter
- Save articles as clean markdown
- Build an article archive

## The Scenario

Jamie bookmarks interesting articles. The bookmarks pile up. Links break. Paywalls appear. Time to archive properly.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d12" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to save web articles as permanent, useful markdown.

### What the Command Does

1. **Gets the URL** - What are we archiving?
2. **Asks why it matters** - Becomes part of your notes
3. **Identifies context** - What project or topic?
4. **Captures your thoughts** - Initial reactions
5. **Creates enriched archive** - Not just content, but context

### What Gets Cleaned Out

- Navigation menus
- Advertisements
- Cookie banners and popups
- Sidebars
- Footer links
- Social sharing buttons
- Comments sections

### What Gets Preserved

- Article headline and subheadings
- Author and date
- Main body content
- Key images (as links)
- Important embedded links
- Block quotes

## Example Output

A clean markdown file with:
- Frontmatter (title, source, URL, date archived)
- "Why I Saved This" section
- Summary of the article
- Clean article content
- Key quotes
- Your notes
- Action items

## Tips for Success

- **Explain why you're saving it** - Crucial for future retrieval
- **Add your thoughts** - Future-you will thank present-you
- **Organise by topic** - Not just a pile of articles
- **Archive now, read later** - Don't lose what matters

## What You Learned

- Web content is ephemeral - archive what matters
- Clean markdown beats cluttered bookmarks
- Personal notes add context for future you
- Organisation makes retrieval easy

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 13: Email Processor](/week-2/day-13-email-processor/), we'll turn threads into action items.
