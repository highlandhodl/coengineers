## What You'll Learn

- Extract transcripts from YouTube videos
- Summarise video content effectively
- Pull key quotes and timestamps
- Create reference notes from video content

## The Scenario

Jamie watches YouTube videos about whisky marketing, distillery tours, and industry trends. Hours of watching, but nothing captured. Time to extract the value.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d10" />

Extract lasting value from every video you watch.

### What We're Building

A system for processing YouTube video transcripts into structured notes with summaries, key quotes, and actionable insights.

### The Challenge

Jamie watches a 45-minute video on "How Small Distilleries Win on Social Media". Lots of good ideas. Two days later? Can't remember any of it. Video notes fix this.

### Getting Transcripts

**Option 1: yt-dlp (command line)**
```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download "VIDEO_URL"
```

**Option 2: YouTube's built-in transcript**
- Click "..." under video → "Show transcript" → Copy

**Option 3: Services like Downsub, etc.**

### Step 1: Create the YouTube Processor

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process-youtube.md:

# Process YouTube Video

You are helping me extract insights from a YouTube video transcript.

## Input
I'll provide:
- Video title and URL
- The transcript (may include timestamps)

## Your Task
Create a video note with:

1. **Metadata**
   - Title, channel, URL
   - Duration (if known)
   - Date watched: today

2. **Summary** (3-5 sentences)
   - What's the main message?
   - Who is this for?

3. **Key Points** (bullet list)
   - The main ideas/arguments
   - Limit to 5-7 points

4. **Notable Quotes** (with timestamps if available)
   - Memorable phrases
   - Insights worth saving

5. **Action Items / Ideas**
   - What should I do based on this?
   - Ideas it sparked

6. **Related Topics**
   - What else should I explore?

## Output Format
Markdown with frontmatter. Be concise - distil, don't transcribe."

### Step 2: Process a Sample Video

Here's a transcript excerpt to practise with:

"Process this YouTube video transcript:

Video: 'Marketing Your Craft Distillery in 2024'
Channel: Spirits Business Weekly
URL: https://youtube.com/watch?v=example

```
[0:00] welcome back to spirits business weekly today we're
talking about how small distilleries can compete with the
big brands on marketing [0:15] i've been visiting distilleries
across scotland and the ones winning aren't outspending
they're out-storying [0:30] first thing authenticity matters
more than production value people want real not polished
[1:00] show your process not just your product take people
behind the scenes [1:30] second user generated content is
gold encourage visitors to share and reshare everything
[2:00] third local partnerships punch above your weight
collaborate with local restaurants cheese makers chocolate
shops [2:45] fourth email is not dead your email list is
your most valuable asset own your audience don't rent it
from social platforms [3:30] finally consistency beats
virality post regularly rather than hoping for hits...
```

Save to week-2-outputs/youtube-marketing-distillery.md"

### Step 3: Add to Your Workflow

"Create a folder at 03-resources/video-notes/ for all processed video notes. Add a README explaining the format."

### Step 4: Quick Capture Mode

Sometimes you just need the highlights:

"Create a slash command process-youtube-quick.md that only extracts: 3-sentence summary, top 3 takeaways, and any action items. Super concise."

### Your Turn

Find a YouTube video relevant to your work. Get the transcript and process it. Add to your video notes collection.

## What You Learned

- YouTube transcripts are freely available
- Long videos distil into short, useful notes
- Quotes with timestamps are referenceable
- Two modes: full notes and quick capture

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process-youtube.md`
- `.claude/commands/process-youtube-quick.md`
- `youtube-marketing-distillery.md` with structured notes
- Video notes folder setup

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 11: PDF Crusher](/week-2/day-11-pdf-crusher/), we'll rip data from PDF reports.
