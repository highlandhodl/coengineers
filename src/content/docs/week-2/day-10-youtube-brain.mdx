## What You'll Learn

- Extract transcripts from YouTube videos
- Summarise video content effectively
- Pull key quotes and timestamps
- Create reference notes from video content

## The Scenario

Jamie watches YouTube videos about whisky marketing, distillery tours, and industry trends. Hours of watching, but nothing captured. Time to extract the value.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d10" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to extract lasting value from YouTube video transcripts.

### What the Command Does

1. **Gets video details** - Title, channel, URL
2. **Understands why you watched** - Context for better extraction
3. **Chooses output mode** - Full notes, quick capture, or quotes only
4. **Identifies connections** - Links to your projects
5. **Processes the transcript** - Distils hours into minutes

### Getting Transcripts

**Option 1: YouTube's built-in transcript**
- Click "..." under video → "Show transcript" → Copy

**Option 2: yt-dlp (command line)**
```bash
yt-dlp --write-auto-sub --skip-download "VIDEO_URL"
```

## Example Output

- **Summary**: 3-5 sentences on the video's message
- **Key Points**: 5-7 main ideas
- **Notable Quotes**: With timestamps
- **Action Items**: What to do based on this
- **Related Topics**: What to explore next

## Tips for Success

- **Get the transcript first** - The command can't watch videos
- **Share why you watched** - Context improves extraction
- **Choose the right mode** - Full notes vs quick capture
- **Link to your work** - Make it actionable

## What You Learned

- YouTube transcripts are freely available
- Long videos distil into short, useful notes
- Quotes with timestamps are referenceable
- Two modes: full notes and quick capture

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 11: PDF Crusher](/week-2/day-11-pdf-crusher/), we'll rip data from PDF reports.
