## What You'll Learn

- Process raw meeting transcripts into structured notes
- Extract speakers, decisions, and action items
- Create consistent meeting note format
- Handle messy, real-world transcripts

## The Scenario

Sarah recorded last week's distributor call. The raw transcript is 47 minutes of rambling. Fiona needs to know what was decided. Jamie to the rescue.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d8" />

Turn messy meeting transcripts into structured, actionable notes.

### What We're Building

A processed meeting note from a raw transcript, with speakers identified, decisions captured, and action items extracted.

### The Input

A raw meeting transcript - messy, unstructured, possibly without clear speaker labels.

### The Output

A clean meeting note with:
- Frontmatter (date, attendees, type)
- Summary (2-3 sentences)
- Key discussion points
- Decisions made
- Action items (who, what, when)

### Step 1: Create the Meeting Processor Command

First, let's build a reusable command:

"Create a slash command at .claude/commands/process-meeting.md:

# Process Meeting Transcript

You are helping me turn a raw meeting transcript into structured notes.

## Input
I'll provide a raw meeting transcript. It may be:
- Messy with poor punctuation
- Missing clear speaker labels
- Long and rambling

## Your Task
1. Identify speakers if possible (from context clues)
2. Summarise the meeting in 2-3 sentences
3. Extract key discussion points (bullet list)
4. Identify decisions that were made
5. Extract action items as a table: Action | Owner | Due Date
6. Note any open questions or parking lot items

## Output Format
Create a markdown file with frontmatter and clear sections.
Use British English. Be concise - cut the fluff."

### Step 2: Process the Example Transcript

Now let's use it. I'll give you a sample transcript:

"Process this meeting transcript using my meeting processor:

[PASTE SAMPLE TRANSCRIPT]

Meeting was between Jamie and Fiona discussing Q1 marketing plans.
Save the output to 01-projects/learning-claude-code/week-2-outputs/distributor-call-processed.md"

### Step 3: Refine the Output

Review what Claude created. Iterate:

"The action items section needs due dates. Can you infer reasonable dates from context, or mark as 'TBD' if unclear? Update the file."

### Step 4: Add to Your Template Library

"Update my meeting note template (templates/meeting-note.md) to match the structure we used for processed meetings. Add a 'Source: transcript' field to frontmatter."

### Sample Transcript for Practice

Here's a sample Thistle & Thorn meeting to process:

```
so fiona was saying we need to get the christmas stuff sorted
jamie said yeah definitely what were you thinking fiona well
i was thinking maybe a tasting event but sarah thinks we dont
have capacity sarah said look we can maybe do 20 people max
if we use the warehouse jamie asked about the social media
plan fiona said priority one is the website its looking dated
jamie agreed to update it by december first sarah will handle
event bookings fiona wants to focus on premium customers not
volume jamie asked about budget fiona said lets keep it under
two thousand pounds for the whole campaign sarah worried about
staffing for the event decided to hire two temp staff for
december jamie to draft social calendar by friday next week
we'll review the website mockups...
```

### Your Turn

Find a real meeting transcript (or create one from notes) and process it with your new command. Compare the before and after.

## What You Learned

- Claude can parse messy, unstructured text
- Speaker identification from context works surprisingly well
- Consistent output format makes notes usable
- Save the command for reuse

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/process-meeting.md`
- `distributor-call-processed.md` with clean structure
- Updated meeting template

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 9: Voice to Text](/week-2/day-9-voice-to-text/), we'll process voice memo transcripts into organised thoughts.
