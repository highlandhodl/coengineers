## What You'll Learn

- Process raw meeting transcripts into structured notes
- Extract speakers, decisions, and action items
- Create consistent meeting note format
- Handle messy, real-world transcripts

## The Scenario

Sarah recorded last week's distributor call. The raw transcript is 47 minutes of rambling. Fiona needs to know what was decided. Jamie to the rescue.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w2.d8" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to process a meeting transcript. It asks about context before processing.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks for the transcript** - Paste it or give a file path
2. **Gathers context** - What kind of meeting? Who was there?
3. **Identifies what matters** - What do you need from this?
4. **Processes with understanding** - Context improves extraction
5. **Creates structured output** - Ready for action

### What You'll Extract

- **Summary** (2-3 sentences)
- **Attendees** (identified from context)
- **Key Discussion Points**
- **Decisions Made**
- **Action Items** (who, what, when)
- **Open Questions**

## Example Output

A clean meeting note with:
- Frontmatter (date, attendees, type)
- Executive summary
- Decisions with owners
- Action items table
- Parking lot for unresolved items

## Tips for Success

- **Provide context** - Meeting type, attendees, purpose
- **Accept imperfection** - Transcripts are messy, that's OK
- **Review action items** - Ensure owners and dates are clear
- **Save the command** - You'll use it again

## What You Learned

- Claude can parse messy, unstructured text
- Speaker identification from context works surprisingly well
- Consistent output format makes notes usable
- Save the command for reuse

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 9: Voice to Text](/week-2/day-9-voice-to-text/), we'll process voice memo transcripts into organised thoughts.
