import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w1.d2" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d2" label="Set up your digital home" />

## What You'll Learn

- Understand what a project workspace is and why it matters
- Create and navigate folders using Claude Code
- Organise files in a logical structure
- Recognise where Claude Code 'sees' files (the current working directory)

## The Scenario

Jamie needs a place to work - a proper workspace where everything has its home. The distillery's files are scattered everywhere. Today you'll build the folder structure that scales with your projects.

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                                       |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directory** | The folder Claude Code currently operates in - where files are created by default |
| **Project Structure** | Organised folders for notes, code, data, and other file types                     |
| **Path Navigation**   | Specifying exactly where files should go using folder paths                       |
| **PARA Method**       | Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive - a proven organisation system                |

## What You'll Create

- Complete folder structure at your chosen location
- README.md files in each folder explaining what goes there
- Your first project folder for this learning journey

## Quick Reference

- **Check location**: Ask "What's my current working directory?"
- **Create folders**: "Create a folder called [name] in [location]"
- **Create with path**: "Create [filename] in [folder/subfolder/]"
- **View structure**: "Show me all files and folders in [folder]"
