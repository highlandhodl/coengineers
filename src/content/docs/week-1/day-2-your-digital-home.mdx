## What You'll Learn

- Understand folder organisation principles (PARA-inspired)
- Create a consistent, scalable structure
- Learn Claude's file system capabilities
- Set up a home for all future work

## The Scenario

Jamie needs somewhere to put everything. The distillery's files are scattered across desktops, email attachments, and "that folder Fiona has somewhere". Time to build a proper home.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d2" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to design a folder structure that fits YOUR workflow - not a generic template.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your current situation** - Where are files now? What's the pain?
2. **Discovers your work patterns** - What kinds of projects do you have?
3. **Identifies ongoing areas** - Responsibilities without deadlines
4. **Helps you choose a location** - Where should your vault live?
5. **Creates personalised structure** - With READMEs that match YOUR context

### The Structure You'll Create

```
[your-vault-name]/
├── 00-inbox/           # Temporary landing zone
├── 01-projects/        # Active work with deadlines
├── 02-areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 03-resources/       # Reference material
├── 04-archive/         # Completed/inactive items
├── templates/          # Reusable templates
└── .claude/
    └── commands/       # Your slash commands
```

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- Complete folder structure at your chosen location
- README.md files in each folder explaining what goes there
- Your first project folder for this learning journey
- Your learning-log.md moved into the right place

## Tips for Success

- **Be honest about your chaos** - The messier the truth, the better the solution
- **Think about real projects** - Give examples from your actual work
- **Don't over-engineer** - Start simple, add folders as needed

## What You Learned

- Consistent folder structure reduces cognitive load
- 00-inbox catches everything before you organise it
- Projects are temporary, Areas are ongoing
- Claude can create and organise files for you

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 3: Project Memory](/week-1/day-3-project-memory/), we'll build your first CLAUDE.md.
