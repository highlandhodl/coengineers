## What You'll Learn

- Understand folder organisation principles (PARA-inspired)
- Create a consistent, scalable structure
- Learn Claude's file system capabilities
- Set up a home for all future work

## The Scenario

Jamie needs somewhere to put everything. The distillery's files are scattered across desktops, email attachments, and "that folder Fiona has somewhere". Time to build a proper home.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d2" />

Today we build the folder structure that holds everything.

### What We're Building

A complete folder hierarchy for your personal knowledge system, ready to hold projects, notes, templates, and archives.

### The Structure We'll Create

```
thistle-thorn-vault/
├── 00-inbox/           # Temporary landing zone
├── 01-projects/        # Active work with deadlines
├── 02-areas/           # Ongoing responsibilities
├── 03-resources/       # Reference material
├── 04-archive/         # Completed/inactive items
├── templates/          # Reusable templates
└── .claude/
    └── commands/       # Your slash commands
```

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Choose Your Location

First, decide where this vault will live. Common choices:
- `~/Documents/vault/`
- `~/notes/`
- `~/second-brain/`

Tell Claude:

```
Create a folder structure for my personal knowledge system at
[YOUR CHOSEN PATH]. Use these folders: 00-inbox, 01-projects,
02-areas, 03-resources, 04-archive, templates. Also create a
.claude/commands folder for slash commands.
```

#### Step 2: Add README Files

Each folder should explain itself. Ask Claude:

```
Add a README.md to each folder explaining what goes there.
Keep it simple - just 2-3 sentences per folder. Use Thistle &
Thorn Distillery as an example business for the descriptions.
```

#### Step 3: Create Your First Project Folder

Let's add a real project inside 01-projects.

```
Create a folder called 'learning-claude-code' inside 01-projects.
Move my learning-log.md from yesterday into this project folder.
Add a README explaining this is my course learning project.
```

#### Step 4: Understand the System

Ask Claude to explain how this should work:

```
Explain how I should use this folder structure day-to-day.
When does something go in inbox vs projects? When do I archive?
Keep it practical.
```

### Your Turn

Customise your structure. Ask Claude to:
- Add any additional folders you need
- Create a folder for a real project you're working on
- Move some existing files into the right places

## Example Outputs

- Complete folder structure with READMEs
- First project folder with learning log moved
- Understanding of PARA-style organisation

## What You Learned

- Consistent folder structure reduces cognitive load
- 00-inbox catches everything before you organise it
- Projects are temporary, Areas are ongoing
- Claude can create and organise files for you

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 3: Project Memory](/week-1/day-3-project-memory/), we'll build your first CLAUDE.md.
