## What You'll Learn

- Review and consolidate Week 1 learning
- Identify gaps and questions
- Celebrate progress
- Prepare for Week 2

## The Scenario

Jamie's first week at Thistle & Thorn is complete. They've got systems in place. Time to review what's working and what needs adjustment.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d7" />

This command guides you through an **interactive retrospective** of Week 1, helping you consolidate learning and prepare for Week 2.

### What the Command Does

1. **Audits your setup** - What did you actually build?
2. **Captures surprises** - What was unexpected?
3. **Identifies winners** - What will you use most?
4. **Finds gaps** - What's still unclear?
5. **Prepares for Week 2** - Content processing awaits

### This Week You Built

- ✓ Learning log and first Claude conversations
- ✓ Folder structure (PARA-style vault)
- ✓ CLAUDE.md project memory
- ✓ Note templates (meeting, project, person)
- ✓ Daily note system
- ✓ Custom slash commands

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- `week-1-retro.md` - Your reflections captured
- System audit showing what's complete
- Identified gaps to address
- Week 2 input folder ready for content processing

## Week 1 Summary
