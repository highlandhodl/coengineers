## What You'll Learn

- Review and consolidate Week 1 learning
- Identify gaps and questions
- Celebrate progress
- Prepare for Week 2

## The Scenario

Jamie's first week at Thistle & Thorn is complete. They've got systems in place. Time to review what's working and what needs adjustment.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d7" />

Time to consolidate and celebrate.

### What We're Building

A Week 1 retrospective document capturing what you learned, built, and want to improve.

### This Week You Built

- ✓ Learning log and first Claude conversations
- ✓ Folder structure (PARA-style vault)
- ✓ CLAUDE.md project memory
- ✓ Note templates (meeting, project, person)
- ✓ Daily note system
- ✓ Custom slash commands

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Audit Your Setup

Ask Claude to check everything is in place:

```
Review my folder structure and list:
- What folders exist
- What templates I have
- What slash commands I've created
- Whether I have a CLAUDE.md

Give me a status report on my Week 1 setup.
```

#### Step 2: Create Week 1 Retrospective

```
Create a retrospective document at 01-projects/learning-claude-code/
week-1-retro.md with:
- Frontmatter: date, week: 1, mood (1-5)
- Sections: What I Built, What Surprised Me, What I'll Use Most,
  Questions I Still Have, Goals for Week 2
```

#### Step 3: Fill In Your Retro

With Claude's help, fill in each section:

```
Help me complete my Week 1 retro. For 'What I Built', list
everything I created this week. For 'What Surprised Me', help me
reflect on what was unexpected about Claude Code.
```

#### Step 4: Identify Gaps

What's missing from your system?

```
Look at my folder structure and templates. What's missing that
a typical knowledge system might have? Suggest 3 additions I
could consider.
```

#### Step 5: Preview Week 2

Week 2 is about processing content. Get ready:

```
Create a folder at 01-projects/learning-claude-code/week-2-inputs/
and add a README explaining this is where I'll put content to
process during Week 2 (meeting notes, transcripts, PDFs, etc.)
```

### Your Turn

Complete your retrospective with honest reflections. Celebrate what you've built!

## What You Learned This Week

| Day | Topic | Key Skill |
