## What You'll Learn

- Understand template-based note creation
- Design templates for common note types
- Learn frontmatter basics
- Create at least 3 reusable templates

## The Scenario

Jamie keeps recreating the same structures. Meeting notes, project briefs, customer records - all start from blank. Templates solve this.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d4" />

Today we build reusable templates for every type of note you create.

### What We're Building

A library of templates: meeting notes, project briefs, person profiles, and any others you need regularly.

### What Makes a Good Template

1. **Frontmatter** - Metadata at the top (title, date, type, tags)
2. **Consistent sections** - Same structure every time
3. **Prompts** - Questions or placeholders to fill in
4. **Flexibility** - Sections you can delete if not needed

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Meeting Notes Template

Create a template for meeting notes.

```
Create a meeting notes template at templates/meeting-note.md
with:
- Frontmatter: title, date, attendees (list), type: meeting
- Sections: Attendees, Agenda, Discussion, Decisions, Actions
- The Actions section should have columns: Action, Owner, Due Date
- Add placeholder text showing what goes where
```

#### Step 2: Project Brief Template

Create a template for new projects.

```
Create a project brief template at templates/project-brief.md
with:
- Frontmatter: title, date, status (not-started/active/complete),
  priority (high/medium/low), owner
- Sections: Overview, Objectives, Success Criteria, Timeline,
  Resources Needed, Risks, Next Steps
- Add guiding questions as placeholders in each section
```

#### Step 3: Person Profile Template

For tracking customers, contacts, team members.

```
Create a person profile template at templates/person-profile.md
with:
- Frontmatter: name, company, role, relationship (customer/partner/
  team/contact), last-contact date, tags
- Sections: Background, Key Interests, Conversation History,
  Notes, Follow-up Actions
- This is for Thistle & Thorn tracking their trade customers
```

#### Step 4: Use a Template

Now let's use one. Ask Claude:

```
Using my meeting template, create a new meeting note for:
Meeting: Weekly Marketing Sync
Date: Today
Attendees: Jamie, Fiona
Agenda: Social media plan, Christmas campaign, website updates
```

#### Step 5: Create Your Own Template

What note type do you create repeatedly?

Ideas:
- Weekly review
- Book/article notes
- Idea capture
- Daily standup
- Customer call

```
Create a template for [YOUR TEMPLATE TYPE] with appropriate
frontmatter and sections.
```

### Your Turn

Create at least 2 more templates for notes you regularly create. Use them for something real.

## Example Outputs

- `templates/meeting-note.md`
- `templates/project-brief.md`
- `templates/person-profile.md`
- At least one personal template

## What You Learned

- Templates ensure consistency
- Frontmatter adds searchable metadata
- Placeholders guide what to fill in
- Build templates for your actual workflow

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 5: The Daily Note](/week-1/day-5-the-daily-note/), we'll build a daily note system.
