## What You'll Learn

- Understand template-based note creation
- Design templates for common note types
- Learn frontmatter basics
- Create at least 3 reusable templates

## The Scenario

Jamie keeps recreating the same structures. Meeting notes, project briefs, customer records - all start from blank. Templates solve this.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d4" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to discover what templates YOU actually need based on your real work patterns.

### What the Command Does

1. **Discovers your patterns** - What notes do you create repeatedly?
2. **Explores meeting styles** - What structure fits your meetings?
3. **Designs project tracking** - What info do new projects need?
4. **Considers people records** - Who do you need to track?
5. **Uncovers unique needs** - Templates specific to your work

### What Makes a Good Template

1. **Frontmatter** - Metadata at the top (title, date, type, tags)
2. **Consistent sections** - Same structure every time
3. **Prompts** - Questions or placeholders to fill in
4. **Flexibility** - Sections you can delete if not needed

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- `templates/meeting-note.md` - For all your meetings
- `templates/project-brief.md` - For new projects
- `templates/person-profile.md` - For tracking people
- Custom templates based on YOUR unique needs

## Tips for Success

- **Focus on what you actually create** - Not hypothetical needs
- **Keep templates simple** - You can always add sections later
- **Use the templates immediately** - Create a real note to test them

## What You Learned

- Templates ensure consistency
- Frontmatter adds searchable metadata
- Placeholders guide what to fill in
- Build templates for your actual workflow

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 5: The Daily Note](/week-1/day-5-the-daily-note/), we'll build a daily note system.
