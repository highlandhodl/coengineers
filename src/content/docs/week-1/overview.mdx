# Week 1: Foundations & Scaffolding

This week, we get everything set up properly. By the end, you'll have a fully scaffolded personal knowledge system with Claude Code configured and project memory established.

## What We're Building

- Claude Code installed and authenticated
- Terminal confidence (the 10 commands you actually need)
- Markdown fluency for all your notes
- A folder structure that scales
- Project memory files that make Claude smarter
- Reusable templates for common note types
- YAML frontmatter standards for your notes

## Daily Breakdown
