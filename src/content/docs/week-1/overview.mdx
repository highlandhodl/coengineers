description: 'Build your Claude Code foundation - conversation, workspace, memory, templates, notes, and commands'
---

**Theme:** "Hello, Claude. Let's build something together."

This week, you'll set up everything you need to work effectively with Claude Code. By Day 7, you'll have a fully scaffolded personal knowledge system with project memory established.

## What You'll Learn

- Have effective conversations with Claude Code
- Create and organise project folder structures
- Build CLAUDE.md files for persistent project memory
- Create reusable note templates with placeholders
- Establish a daily note practice
- Build your own custom slash commands

## The Thistle & Thorn Story

Fiona has just hired Jamie to handle marketing at the distillery. Jamie's first task: get the scattered knowledge organised. They'll build a proper system from scratch — and you will too.
