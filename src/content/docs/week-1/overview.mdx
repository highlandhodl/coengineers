# Week 1: Foundations & Scaffolding

**Theme:** "Hello, Claude. Let's build something together."

This week, you'll set up everything you need to work effectively with Claude Code. By Day 7, you'll have a fully scaffolded personal knowledge system with Claude Code configured and project memory established.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of Week 1, you'll be able to:

1. Have effective conversations with Claude Code
2. Create and organise project folder structures
3. Build CLAUDE.md files for project memory
4. Create reusable note templates
5. Design frontmatter schemas for structured notes
6. Create your own custom slash commands

## Week 1 Outcome

A fully scaffolded personal knowledge system with Claude Code configured and project memory established.

## The Thistle & Thorn Story

Fiona has just hired Jamie to handle marketing. Jamie's first task: get the distillery's scattered knowledge organised. They'll build a proper system from scratch - and you will too.
