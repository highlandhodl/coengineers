## Key Concepts

### What Is Claude Code?

Claude Code is a command-line AI assistant. Unlike ChatGPT's web interface, it runs in your terminal and can interact with files on your computer. This makes it incredibly powerful for automating real work.

### How the Agent Thinks

When you give Claude Code a task, it:

1. **Reads** your request
2. **Plans** what steps to take
3. **Acts** using available tools (reading files, running commands, etc.)
4. **Checks** if the result matches your goal
5. **Iterates** until the task is complete

You can watch this process in real-time, which helps you understand what's happening.

### Basic Commands

| Command | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `claude` | Start Claude Code |
| `/help` | Show available commands |
| `/exit` | Quit Claude Code |
| `/clear` | Clear the conversation |

## Try It Yourself

1. Open your terminal
2. Run `claude`
3. Type: "Create a simple markdown file called hello.md with a greeting"
4. Watch Claude create the file
5. Check your current folder — the file should be there

## Common Issues

**Claude seems slow**
- First responses take longer as the model loads
- Subsequent responses are faster

**Claude did something unexpected**
- You can always undo by deleting files or reverting changes
- Be specific in your requests to get better results
