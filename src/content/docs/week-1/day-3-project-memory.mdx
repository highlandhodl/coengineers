import SlashCommand from '../../../components/SlashCommand.astro';
import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w1.d3" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d3" label="Give Claude project memory" />

## What You'll Learn

- Understand what CLAUDE.md files are and why they matter
- Create a CLAUDE.md file with project-specific instructions
- Update and refine instructions based on what you learn
- Recognise how Claude Code uses this memory across conversations

## The Scenario

Jamie keeps explaining the same things to Claude. "We're a whisky distillery... we use metric measurements... we write in British English..." There's a better way: CLAUDE.md gives Claude persistent memory.

## Key Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                                    |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **CLAUDE.md**       | A special file Claude reads at the start of every conversation |
| **Project Context** | Description, tech stack, goals, and current focus              |
| **Preferences**     | Language preferences, coding standards, communication style    |
| **Hierarchy**       | Global (home directory) vs project-level CLAUDE.md files       |

## What You'll Create

- `CLAUDE.md` in your project root with personalised context
- Instructions Claude follows automatically in every conversation

## Quick Reference

- **Location**: Place CLAUDE.md in your project root
- **Sections**: Project Description, Preferences, Coding Standards, Current Focus
- **Global vs Local**: Home directory = all projects, project folder = this project only
- **Keep it concise**: Claude reads it every time - brevity matters
