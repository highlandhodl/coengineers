## What You'll Learn

- Understand what CLAUDE.md does (persistent project context)
- Learn what to include vs exclude
- Create a CLAUDE.md for a real project
- Experience Claude "remembering" your context

## The Scenario

Jamie keeps explaining the same things to Claude. "We're a whisky distillery... we use metric measurements... we write in British English..." There must be a better way. There is: CLAUDE.md.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d3" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to create a CLAUDE.md that captures everything important about your project.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your project** - What is it? What are you building?
2. **Identifies key people** - Who's involved?
3. **Captures conventions** - Language, terminology, patterns
4. **Gathers context** - What should Claude always know?
5. **Documents anti-patterns** - What should Claude avoid?

### What Goes in CLAUDE.md

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
What this project is about, in 2-3 sentences.

## Key People
- Who's involved and what they do

## Conventions
- Spelling (British/American)
- Terminology
- File naming patterns

## Important Context
- Domain knowledge
- Constraints

## What to Avoid
- Anti-patterns
- Previous mistakes
```

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- `CLAUDE.md` in your project root
- Personalised context Claude reads automatically
- The ability to test it by starting a fresh conversation

## Tips for Success

- **Keep it concise** - Claude reads it every time, so brevity matters
- **Focus on what changes behaviour** - Not general information
- **Be specific about conventions** - They matter for consistency

## What You Learned

- CLAUDE.md gives Claude persistent project memory
- Put it in the project root folder
- Include conventions, not conversations
- Keep it concise - Claude reads it every time

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 4: Template Factory](/week-1/day-4-template-factory/), we'll create reusable note templates.
