## What You'll Learn

- Understand what CLAUDE.md does (persistent project context)
- Learn what to include vs exclude
- Create a CLAUDE.md for a real project
- Experience Claude "remembering" your context

## The Scenario

Jamie keeps explaining the same things to Claude. "We're a whisky distillery... we use metric measurements... we write in British English..." There must be a better way. There is: CLAUDE.md.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d3" />

Today we teach Claude to remember your project context.

### What We're Building

A CLAUDE.md file that gives Claude persistent memory about your project - who you are, what you're building, how you work.

### What Goes in CLAUDE.md

A typical CLAUDE.md includes:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview
What this project is about, in 2-3 sentences.

## Key Context
- Who uses this
- What problem it solves
- Important constraints

## Conventions
- Spelling (British/American)
- Terminology
- File naming patterns

## Tech Stack (if applicable)
- Languages/frameworks
- Key dependencies

## Patterns
- Code patterns to follow
- Document structures used
- Naming conventions
```

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create CLAUDE.md for Your Learning Project

Navigate to your learning-claude-code project folder.

```
Create a CLAUDE.md file in my learning-claude-code project.
Include: an overview explaining I'm learning Claude Code over
31 days, that I use British English, and that I work in
[YOUR FIELD/CONTEXT]. Add sections for conventions and patterns.
```

#### Step 2: Add Specific Context

Now add details relevant to YOUR situation.

```
Update the CLAUDE.md to include:
- My role/job context: [YOUR DETAILS]
- File naming convention: lowercase-with-dashes
- Preferred output format: markdown with frontmatter
- Any tools I commonly use: [YOUR TOOLS]
```

#### Step 3: Test the Memory

Start a fresh conversation and see if Claude remembers.

```
Based on my project context, what conventions should I follow
when creating a new document?
```

Claude should reference your CLAUDE.md without you reminding it.

#### Step 4: Create CLAUDE.md for Thistle & Thorn

Let's practice with the fictional company.

```
Create a CLAUDE.md for Thistle & Thorn Distillery with:
- Overview: Craft whisky distillery in Speyside, 4th generation
- British English spelling
- Key people: Fiona (owner), Jamie (marketing), Hamish (cooper)
- Products: Single malt whisky, gin, distillery experiences
- Tone: Warm, proud heritage, approachable
```

### Your Turn

Create a CLAUDE.md for a real project of your own. Include:
- What the project is
- Your conventions and preferences
- Any context Claude should always know

## Example Outputs

- CLAUDE.md for learning project
- CLAUDE.md for Thistle & Thorn
- Experience of context-aware responses

## What You Learned

- CLAUDE.md gives Claude persistent project memory
- Put it in the project root folder
- Include conventions, not conversations
- Keep it concise - Claude reads it every time

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 4: Template Factory](/week-1/day-4-template-factory/), we'll create reusable note templates.
