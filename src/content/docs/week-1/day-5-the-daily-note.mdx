## What You'll Learn

- Create structured daily notes using Claude Code
- Build a template for consistent daily documentation
- Organise daily notes in a date-based structure
- Use daily notes to track progress and spot patterns

## The Scenario

Jamie does loads of work every day but can't remember what they did last Tuesday. Daily notes fix this - simple documents tracking focus, progress, blockers, and ideas. They're breadcrumbs for future you.

## Key Concepts

| Concept                | Description                                                     |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Daily Note**         | A dated document tracking your day's work and thinking          |
| **Focus vs Completed** | What you plan to do vs what you actually finish                 |
| **Blockers**           | What's stopping progress - patterns here reveal systemic issues |
| **Weekly Review**      | Summarising daily notes to spot patterns and plan ahead         |

## What You'll Create

- `daily-notes/` folder with date-organised files
- A daily note template for consistent structure
- Your first real daily note with actual content

## Quick Reference

- **Structure**: Focus, Completed, In Progress, Blockers, Notes, Tomorrow
- **Timing**: Pick morning or evening and stay consistent
- **Keep it short**: 5-10 minutes daily, bullet points not essays
- **Review weekly**: Ask Claude to summarise patterns across notes
