## What You'll Learn

- Understand daily notes as a practice
- Design a daily note template
- Create dated notes automatically
- Link daily notes to projects and people

## The Scenario

Jamie wants to track what they do each day - for accountability, memory, and building a trail of work. Daily notes are the foundation.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d5" />

Today we build a daily note practice that captures everything.

### What We're Building

A daily note template and your first daily note for today.

### Daily Note Purpose

- **Capture** everything that happens
- **Plan** what you'll do today
- **Reflect** on what you learned
- **Link** to projects, people, ideas

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create Daily Note Template

```
Create a daily note template at templates/daily-note.md with:
- Frontmatter: date, weekday, energy-level (1-5), tags
- Sections:
  - Focus (top 3 priorities today)
  - Log (timestamped entries)
  - Notes (thoughts, ideas, learnings)
  - Tomorrow (what's carrying over)
- Make the Log section a simple bullet list for quick entries
```

#### Step 2: Create Today's Daily Note

```
Using my daily note template, create today's note at
01-projects/learning-claude-code/daily/[TODAY'S DATE].md

Fill in:
- Today's date and weekday
- Focus: Learning Claude Code Day 5
- Add a log entry for right now about completing Day 5
```

#### Step 3: Practice Quick Capture

Throughout today, add entries to your daily note.

```
Add a log entry to today's daily note:
[TIME] - Completed daily note template setup
```

#### Step 4: Create a Folder for Daily Notes

```
Create a 'daily' folder inside my learning project if it
doesn't exist. This is where all daily notes will live.
```

### Your Turn

- Create tomorrow's daily note in advance
- Add 3 entries to today's note about things you're doing
- Link to a project or person if relevant: [[project-name]]

## Example Outputs

- `templates/daily-note.md`
- Today's daily note with real entries
- Daily notes folder structure

## What You Learned

- Daily notes are low-effort, high-value
- Timestamped logs create an audit trail
- The practice compounds over time
- Quick capture beats perfect capture

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 6: Your First Slash Command](/week-1/day-6-your-first-slash-command/), we'll create custom commands.
