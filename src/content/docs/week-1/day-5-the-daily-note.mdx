## What You'll Learn

- Understand daily notes as a practice
- Design a daily note template
- Create dated notes automatically
- Link daily notes to projects and people

## The Scenario

Jamie wants to track what they do each day - for accountability, memory, and building a trail of work. Daily notes are the foundation.

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d5" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to design a daily note system that fits YOUR routine.

### What the Command Does

1. **Understands your current habits** - How do you capture things now?
2. **Maps your daily rhythm** - When are you busy? When can you reflect?
3. **Identifies what matters** - What's worth recording for future-you?
4. **Considers tracking needs** - Energy, mood, or simple logging?
5. **Sets up the structure** - Template and folder where notes live

### Daily Note Purpose

- **Capture** everything that happens
- **Plan** what you'll do today
- **Reflect** on what you learned
- **Link** to projects, people, ideas

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- `templates/daily-note.md` - Your daily note template
- Today's daily note - Already created and started
- A folder structure for daily notes
- A practice that compounds over time

## Tips for Success

- **Quick capture beats perfect capture** - Something is better than nothing
- **Timestamps help** - Future-you will want to know when
- **Don't overthink it** - Start simple, refine over time
- **Consistency matters more than detail** - Show up daily

## What You Learned

- Daily notes are low-effort, high-value
- Timestamped logs create an audit trail
- The practice compounds over time
- Quick capture beats perfect capture

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 6: Your First Slash Command](/week-1/day-6-your-first-slash-command/), we'll create custom commands.
