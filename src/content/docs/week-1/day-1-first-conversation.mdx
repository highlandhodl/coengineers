## What You'll Learn

- Start a conversation with Claude Code in the terminal
- Ask clear, effective questions
- Understand how Claude responds and why it asks for clarification
- Create your first output file using natural language

## The Scenario

Jamie's first day at Thistle & Thorn. They open Claude Code for the first time. What do they say? How does this work? You'll discover that Claude Code is simply a conversation - if you can talk, you can use it.

## Key Concepts

| Concept               | Description                                                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Conversational AI** | Claude Code is not a command system - it's a conversation partner  |
| **Specificity**       | The more detail you provide, the better the response               |
| **Clarification**     | Claude asks questions to ensure it gives you exactly what you need |
| **Iteration**         | Refining outputs through back-and-forth dialogue is normal         |

## What You'll Create

- `learning-log.md` - A personalised learning journal with space for daily observations, prompts that worked well, and questions for tomorrow

## Quick Reference

- **Greeting Claude**: Just say hello - there's no special syntax
- **Getting help**: Ask "What can you help me with?"
- **Creating files**: Describe what you want, Claude will ask for specifics
- **Reading files**: Ask "Can you show me what's in [filename]?"
