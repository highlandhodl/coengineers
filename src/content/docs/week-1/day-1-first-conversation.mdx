## What You'll Learn

- Understand how Claude Code thinks and responds
- Learn effective prompting techniques
- Experience the conversational flow
- Create your first output file

## The Scenario

Jamie's first day at Thistle & Thorn. They open Claude Code for the first time. What do they say? How does this work?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d1" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** of your first Claude Code conversation. Rather than following static instructions, Claude will ask you questions to personalise the experience.

### What the Command Does

1. **Asks about your context** - Your role, your work, your goals
2. **Explains how Claude works** - Capabilities and conversational flow
3. **Creates your first file** - A personalised `learning-log.md`
4. **Demonstrates iteration** - Shows how to refine outputs
5. **Reveals a surprise capability** - Something relevant to your work

### Why Interactive?

The command asks questions first because:
- Your context shapes better responses
- Learning sticks when it's relevant to YOU
- You'll discover patterns that work for your specific needs

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- `learning-log.md` - A personalised learning journal with:
  - Your context and goals
  - Space for daily observations
  - Prompts that worked well
  - Things you learned
  - Questions for tomorrow

## Tips for Success

- **Give context freely** - The more Claude knows, the better it helps
- **Be honest about confusion** - If something doesn't make sense, say so
- **Experiment after** - Try 3-5 prompts of your own after the walkthrough

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Claude says it can't do something | Rephrase with more context |
| Claude does something unexpected | Say "stop" and explain what you wanted |
| Claude asks too many questions | Give more upfront context |

## What You Learned

- Claude works best with context, not just commands
- You can watch Claude work in real-time
- Iteration is normal - refine as you go
- Claude can explain itself and its capabilities

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 2: Your Digital Home](/week-1/day-2-your-digital-home/), we'll create a folder structure that scales.
