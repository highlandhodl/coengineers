## What You'll Learn

- Understand how Claude Code thinks and responds
- Learn effective prompting techniques
- Experience the conversational flow
- Create your first output file

## The Scenario

Jamie's first day at Thistle & Thorn. They open Claude Code for the first time. What do they say? How does this work?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d1" />

Welcome to Day 1! Today you'll have your first real conversation with Claude Code and learn how it thinks.

### What We're Building

A markdown file containing your first experiments with Claude - a record of what works, what doesn't, and what surprises you.

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Say Hello (Properly)

Don't just say "hello". Give Claude context about who you are and what you're trying to do.

Try this:

```
I'm learning Claude Code. I work at a small whisky distillery
and I'm trying to get our knowledge organised. Can you explain
how you work - what can you do, and what should I know about
working with you?
```

Watch what Claude says. Notice how it explains its capabilities.

#### Step 2: Ask Claude to Create Something

Now ask Claude to create a simple file. Be specific about what you want.

Try this:

```
Create a markdown file called 'learning-log.md' in my current
directory. Start it with today's date and a section called
'Day 1 Observations'. Leave space for me to add notes.
```

Watch Claude work. Notice:
- It tells you what it's doing
- It creates the file
- It shows you the result

#### Step 3: Give Feedback and Iterate

Now modify what Claude created. Practice the back-and-forth.

Try:

```
Add a section called 'Prompts That Worked' and another called
'Things I Learned'. Format them as bullet lists.
```

#### Step 4: Explore Capabilities

Ask Claude what else it can do. Be curious.

Try:

```
What are 5 things you can do that might surprise me? Show me
an example of one of them.
```

#### Step 5: Document Your Learning

Add your observations to the learning log Claude created.

Ask Claude:

```
Help me write up what I learned today in the learning log.
I want to capture: what surprised me, what prompts worked well,
and what I want to try tomorrow.
```

### Your Turn

Now experiment freely. Try 3-5 prompts of your own. Add the results to your learning log.

Ideas to try:
- Ask Claude to explain something you don't understand
- Ask Claude to help you plan something
- Ask Claude to find files on your computer
- Ask Claude to summarise something

## Example Outputs

- `learning-log.md` with dated entries
- First observations about Claude's capabilities
- List of prompts that worked well

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Claude says it can't do something | Rephrase with more context |
| Claude does something unexpected | Say "stop" and explain what you wanted |
| Claude asks too many questions | Give more upfront context |

## What You Learned

- Claude works best with context, not just commands
- You can watch Claude work in real-time
- Iteration is normal - refine as you go
- Claude can explain itself and its capabilities

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 2: Your Digital Home](/week-1/day-2-your-digital-home/), we'll create a folder structure that scales.
