## What You'll Learn

- Understand how slash commands work
- Write a slash command from scratch
- Test and iterate on commands
- Build a command for a real use case

## The Scenario

Jamie finds themselves asking Claude the same things repeatedly. "Summarise this meeting..." "Turn this into action items..." What if they could save these prompts and reuse them with one command?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d6" />

This command guides you through an **interactive walkthrough** to identify the RIGHT command to build - one that will actually save you time.

### What the Command Does

1. **Finds your repetition** - What do you ask Claude repeatedly?
2. **Identifies the pain** - Which task is most tedious?
3. **Captures the dream** - What would the perfect command do?
4. **Designs the command** - Input, output, format
5. **Creates and tests it** - Iterate until it works

### How Slash Commands Work

1. They live in `.claude/commands/` folder
2. They're markdown files with prompts
3. When you type `/command-name`, Claude reads the file
4. You can include instructions, context, and examples

## Example Output

After running the command, you'll have:

- A custom slash command for something YOU do repeatedly
- Understanding of command structure
- Confidence to create more commands

### Command Ideas

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/summarise` | Summarise any content into key points |
| `/action-items` | Extract action items from any text |
| `/explain` | Explain something simply |
| `/fix-writing` | Fix grammar and improve clarity |
| `/daily-review` | End of day reflection prompts |

## Tips for Success

- **Build for real pain** - Not hypothetical needs
- **Keep it focused** - One command, one purpose
- **Test with real content** - Not just examples
- **Iterate** - First version is rarely perfect

## What You Learned

- Slash commands are reusable prompts
- They live in `.claude/commands/`
- You can iterate and improve them
- One command can save hours over time

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 7: Week 1 Review](/week-1/day-7-week-1-review/), we'll consolidate everything we've learned.
