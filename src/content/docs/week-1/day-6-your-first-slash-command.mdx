## What You'll Learn

- Understand how slash commands work
- Write a slash command from scratch
- Test and iterate on commands
- Build a command for a real use case

## The Scenario

Jamie finds themselves asking Claude the same things repeatedly. "Summarise this meeting..." "Turn this into action items..." What if they could save these prompts and reuse them with one command?

## The Slash Command

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d6" />

Today you become a slash command creator.

### What We're Building

Your own custom slash command that solves a real problem you face regularly.

### How Slash Commands Work

1. They live in `.claude/commands/` folder
2. They're markdown files with prompts
3. When you type `/command-name`, Claude reads the file
4. You can include instructions, context, and examples

### Let's Go

#### Step 1: Create the Commands Folder

```
Check if I have a .claude/commands folder. If not, create it.
This is where all my slash commands will live.
```

#### Step 2: Create a Simple Command

Let's build a meeting summariser.

```
Create a slash command at .claude/commands/summarise-meeting.md
with this content:

# Summarise Meeting

You are helping me summarise meeting notes.

Take the meeting content I provide and create:
1. A one-sentence summary
2. Key decisions (bullet list)
3. Action items with owners (table format)
4. Any open questions

Format the output in clean markdown.

Keep it concise. No fluff.
```

#### Step 3: Test Your Command

Now test it. Run `/summarise-meeting` and provide some notes:

```
Here's a test meeting:

Meeting: Q4 Planning
Attendees: Fiona, Jamie, Sarah

Discussion:
- Website needs updating before Christmas
- Jamie will handle social media posts
- Consider running a Christmas tasting event
- Sarah worried about capacity for events
- Fiona wants to focus on premium customers

Decision: Go ahead with tasting event, cap at 20 people
Decision: Website update by Dec 1st

Next: Jamie to draft social calendar by Friday
```

#### Step 4: Iterate and Improve

Based on the output, refine your command.

```
Update my summarise-meeting command to also include:
- A 'Mood/Vibe' one-liner at the start
- Deadlines highlighted in bold in action items
```

#### Step 5: Create Your Own Command

What do you ask Claude repeatedly? Turn it into a command.

Ideas:
- `/explain` - Explain something simply
- `/fix-grammar` - Fix grammar and spelling
- `/action-items` - Extract action items from text
- `/daily-review` - End of day reflection prompts
- `/idea-expand` - Take a rough idea and expand it

```
Create a slash command called [YOUR NAME] that [WHAT IT DOES].
Include clear instructions and an example of good output.
```

### Your Turn

Create at least 2 more slash commands for tasks you do regularly. Test each one with real content.

## Example Outputs

- `.claude/commands/summarise-meeting.md`
- At least 2 personal slash commands
- Understanding of command structure

## What You Learned

- Slash commands are reusable prompts
- They live in `.claude/commands/`
- You can iterate and improve them
- One command can save hours over time

## What's Next?

Tomorrow in [Day 7: Week 1 Review](/week-1/day-7-week-1-review/), we'll consolidate everything we've learned.
