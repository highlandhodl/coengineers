import SlashCommand from '../../../components/SlashCommand.astro';
import ReferenceHubCallout from '../../../components/ReferenceHubCallout.astro';

<ReferenceHubCallout command="/w1.d6" />

## Start the Lesson

<SlashCommand code="/w1.d6" label="Create your first slash command" />

## What You'll Learn

- Understand what slash commands are and how they work
- Create a custom slash command in the .claude/commands folder
- Execute slash commands from the terminal
- Build commands for your own repetitive workflows

## The Scenario

Jamie has workflows they run daily - creating notes, processing files, summarising content. Instead of typing full prompts each time, slash commands let you type `/daily-note` and it just happens. One word, instant execution.

## Key Concepts

| Concept             | Description                                               |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Slash Command**   | A shortcut that executes a saved prompt with one word     |
| **Commands Folder** | `.claude/commands/` where command files live              |
| **Frontmatter**     | The name and description at the top of command files      |
| **Automation**      | Turning repetitive prompts into instant one-word triggers |

## What You'll Create

- `.claude/commands/` folder structure
- `/daily-note` command for automatic daily note creation
- `/weekly-summary` command for reviewing your week
- At least one custom command for your own workflow

## Quick Reference

- **Location**: `.claude/commands/[name].md`
- **Format**: Frontmatter (name, description) + prompt body
- **Execute**: Type `/command-name` in Claude Code
- **Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names like `/meeting-summary`
