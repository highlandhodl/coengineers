# Installing Claude Code

Let's get Claude Code installed on your machine. This takes about 5 minutes.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have:

- A Mac, Windows, or Linux computer
- An internet connection
- An Anthropic account with a Claude Code licence (we'll set this up if you don't have one)
- [Course materials](/getting-started/prerequisites/#getting-the-course-code) downloaded or cloned

## Step 1: Install Node.js (if you don't have it)

Claude Code runs on Node.js. Don't worry — you don't need to know what that means, just install it.

**On Mac:**

```bash
# Open Terminal (press Cmd + Space, type "Terminal", hit Enter)
# Then paste this and hit Enter:
brew install node
```

Don't have Homebrew? Get it first:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

**On Windows:**

1. Download the installer from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Run it and click "Next" through all the steps
3. Restart your computer

**On Linux:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

## Step 2: Install Claude Code

Open your terminal and run:

```bash
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
```

This installs Claude Code globally so you can use it from anywhere.

## Step 3: Authenticate

Run this command:

```bash
claude auth
```

This opens your browser. Sign in to your Anthropic account (or create one if you haven't).

## Step 4: Verify It Works

```bash
claude
```

You should see Claude Code start up. Type "Hello" and hit Enter. If Claude responds, you're all set.

Type `/exit` to quit.

## Step 5: Install Obsidian (Recommended)

Most labs in this course use Obsidian for knowledge management. It's free and works beautifully with the workflows we'll build.

1. Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md/)
2. Download the installer for your platform
3. Install and open Obsidian
4. Create a new vault called "CoEngineers Workspace" (or any name you like)
5. Note the folder location — you'll need this in Lab 1

You can skip this for now and come back later, but Themes 1 and 2 will make a lot more sense with Obsidian installed.

## Troubleshooting

**"command not found: claude"**

- Try closing and reopening your terminal
- On Mac/Linux, you might need to add npm to your PATH
- Run `npm config get prefix` to see where npm installs global packages

**"Authentication failed"**

- Make sure you're signed in to the correct Anthropic account
- Try running `claude auth` again
- Check your internet connection

**"npm: command not found"**

- Node.js didn't install properly
- Try reinstalling Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
- Restart your terminal after installation

**Claude Code starts but won't respond**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify authentication with `claude auth`
- Make sure you have API credits available (check your Anthropic dashboard)

**Still stuck?**

- Check the [Claude Code documentation](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code)
- Visit the [Troubleshooting Guide](/reference/troubleshooting/)
- Review the [FAQ](/reference/faq/)

## Next Steps

Now that you've got Claude Code installed, check the [Prerequisites](/getting-started/prerequisites/) for the optional tools we'll use throughout the course.

Or jump straight to [Theme 1: Digital Workspace](/theme-1/overview/) to start building your productivity system.
