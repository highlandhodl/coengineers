✅ "Create a file called meeting-notes.md in ~/Documents with today's date as the title"
```

### Provide Context

```
❌ "Summarise this"
✅ "Read the meeting transcript in @meeting-raw.md and extract:
   1. Key decisions made
   2. Action items with owners
   3. Questions for follow-up"
```

### Request Format

```
❌ "Give me a summary"
✅ "Summarise this in a markdown table with columns:
   Topic | Decision | Owner | Due Date"
```
