## Course Slash Commands

These are the custom commands created for each lab in this course:

| Command               | Theme                       | What It Does                                |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `/t1.lb1` - `/t1.lb5` | Theme 1: Digital Workspace  | Set up workspace, templates, knowledge base |
| `/t2.lb1` - `/t2.lb5` | Theme 2: Content Processing | Process meetings, PDFs, web content, voice  |
| `/t3.lb1` - `/t3.lb5` | Theme 3: Document Creation  | Generate docs, spreadsheets, presentations  |
| `/t4.lb1` - `/t4.lb5` | Theme 4: External APIs      | Connect to Gamma, Gemini, ElevenLabs        |

To use a slash command:

1. Start Claude Code in your workspace directory
2. Type the command (e.g., `/t1.lb1`)
3. Follow the prompts
4. Review the output

## Effective Prompting Patterns

### Be Specific

```
❌ "Create a file"
✅ "Create a file called meeting-notes.md in ~/Documents/Obsidian/Meetings with today's date as the title"
```

### Provide Context

```
❌ "Summarise this"
✅ "Read the meeting transcript in @meeting-raw.md and extract:
   1. Key decisions made
   2. Action items with owners
   3. Questions for follow-up"
```

### Request Format

```
❌ "Give me a summary"
✅ "Summarise this in a markdown table with columns:
   Topic | Decision | Owner | Due Date"
```

### Reference Files

```
❌ "Look at the file"
✅ "Read @project-spec.md and create a task list from the requirements section"
```

## Common File Operations

| Task        | Prompt Pattern                                             |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Create file | "Create a file called X in folder Y with content Z"        |
| Read file   | "Read @filename.md and summarise the key points"           |
| Edit file   | "In @filename.md, change the section on X to say Y"        |
| Search      | "Find all files in ~/Documents containing the word 'spec'" |
| Move file   | "Move @old-location.md to ~/Documents/Archive/"            |
| Rename file | "Rename @draft.md to @final.md"                            |

## Claude Code Skills Reference

<Aside type="tip" title="What are Skills?">
  Skills are built-in capabilities that Claude Code can use to create specific
  types of documents. No additional setup required.
</Aside>

| Skill            | Command Pattern                              | Output                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| docx             | "Use the docx skill to create..."            | Word document (.docx)     |
| xlsx             | "Use the xlsx skill to create..."            | Excel spreadsheet (.xlsx) |
| pptx             | "Use the pptx skill to create..."            | PowerPoint (.pptx)        |
| brand-guidelines | "Use the brand-guidelines skill to create... | Brand document (.docx)    |

**Example:**

```
"Use the pptx skill to create a presentation about quarterly results with:
- Slide 1: Title slide
- Slide 2: Revenue chart
- Slide 3: Key metrics table
- Slide 4: Next steps"
```

## CLAUDE.md Template

Every project benefits from a `CLAUDE.md` file that tells Claude Code how you work:

```markdown
# Project Name

## Overview

Brief description of this project and what you're building.

## Key Files

- `src/` - Source code or main content
- `docs/` - Documentation
- `templates/` - Reusable templates
- `archive/` - Old versions

## Conventions

- Use British English (colour, organisation, behaviour)
- Dates in DD/MM/YYYY format
- Markdown for all documentation
- File names in kebab-case (like-this.md)

## Common Tasks

- Create blog post: "Use the blog-post template to..."
- Process meeting: "Read @meeting-raw.md and extract..."
- Generate report: "Use the docx skill to..."

## Context

Add any project-specific context that Claude Code should know about your preferences, workflow, or requirements.
```

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Terminal)

These work in most terminals:

| Shortcut      | Action                          |
| ------------- | ------------------------------- |
| `Ctrl+C`      | Cancel current operation        |
| `Ctrl+D`      | Exit Claude Code session        |
| `↑` / `↓`     | Navigate command history        |
| `Ctrl+L`      | Clear terminal screen           |
| `Cmd+K` (Mac) | Clear terminal screen           |
| `Tab`         | Auto-complete file/folder names |

## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

| Issue                   | Solution                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "command not found"     | Ensure Claude Code is installed: `npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code` |
| "Authentication failed" | Run `claude auth` and sign in again                                         |
| "Rate limited"          | Wait a few minutes before trying again                                      |
| "File not found"        | Check the path with `ls` — use absolute paths if relative paths don't work  |
| "Permission denied"     | Check file permissions with `ls -la filename`                               |
| "Cannot read file"      | Make sure you're in the right directory — use `pwd` to check                |
| "API error"             | Check your internet connection and API credits                              |
| Claude Code won't start | Restart terminal, verify Node.js is installed: `node --version`             |

## British English Reminders

Common words you'll see throughout the course:

| British        | American (don't use) |
| -------------- | -------------------- |
| colour         | color                |
| organise       | organize             |
| behaviour      | behavior             |
| optimised      | optimized            |
| licence (noun) | license (noun)       |
| analyse        | analyze              |
| summarise      | summarize            |

This matters for file names, folder structures, and prompts that use specific terminology.
