# Welcome to 31 Days of Claude Code

Right, let's get you sorted.

This course teaches you how to use Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding assistant — to automate the boring bits of your work. No programming experience needed. No technical background required. Just you, your terminal, and a willingness to try something new.

## What You'll Walk Away With

By Day 31, you'll have:

- A fully organised personal knowledge system
- Tools to process any content (transcripts, PDFs, voice memos)
- Automations that generate presentations, podcasts, and video briefs
- Templates for blogs, newsletters, proposals, and case studies
- The confidence to build your own automations

## How This Course Works

Every day in January, you get:

1. **A short video** (5-10 minutes) showing you exactly what to do
2. **A slash command** you can copy and use immediately
3. **Example files** so you can follow along

No homework. No quizzes. Just practical tools you can use straight away.

## Who This Is For

- **Knowledge workers** drowning in notes, docs, and meetings
- **Content creators** who spend more time formatting than creating
- **Small business owners** who can't afford to hire a team
- **Anyone** who thinks "there must be a better way"

## Who This Isn't For

- Developers looking for advanced coding tutorials (this is too basic for you)
- People who want theory without practice (every lesson has a hands-on exercise)
- Those expecting magic (you still have to do the work — just less of it)

## Ready?
