# Welcome to CoEngineers

Right, let's get you sorted.

This course teaches you how to use Claude Code — Anthropic's AI coding assistant — to automate the boring bits of your work. No programming experience needed. No technical background required. Just you, your terminal, and a willingness to try something new.

## What You'll Walk Away With

After completing 20 hands-on labs across 4 practical themes, you'll have:

- A fully organised personal knowledge system that actually works
- Tools to process any content (transcripts, PDFs, web pages, voice memos)
- The ability to generate professional documents, presentations, and reports
- Automations that connect Claude Code to external APIs
- Templates you can reuse for blogs, newsletters, proposals, and case studies
- The confidence to build your own workflows

## How This Course Works

The course is organised into 4 themes, each with 5 practical labs:

**Theme 1: Digital Workspace** (Labs 1-5)
Build your foundation. Set up your digital workspace, create reusable templates, and learn to organise knowledge effectively using Claude Code and Obsidian.

**Theme 2: Content Processing** (Labs 6-10)
Process any content. Extract insights from meetings, transcripts, PDFs, web pages, and voice recordings. Turn raw information into structured knowledge.

**Theme 3: Document Creation** (Labs 11-15)
Create professional outputs. Generate Word documents, Excel spreadsheets, PowerPoint presentations, and custom brand guidelines using Claude Code's built-in skills.

**Theme 4: External APIs** (Labs 16-20)
Connect to the world. Integrate Claude Code with external services like Gamma (presentations), Google AI Studio (images), and ElevenLabs (voice synthesis).

Each lab takes 20-30 minutes and includes:

- Step-by-step instructions you can follow along
- A ready-to-use slash command (like `/t1.lb1`)
- Example files so you can see it working
- Practical outputs you can use immediately

No homework. No quizzes. Just practical tools you can use straight away.

## Who This Is For

- **Product managers** who need to document decisions, create specs, and communicate with stakeholders
- **Content creators** who spend more time formatting than creating
- **Knowledge workers** drowning in notes, docs, and meeting transcripts
- **Small business owners** who can't afford to hire a team for every task
- **Anyone** who thinks "there must be a better way"

## Who This Isn't For

- Developers looking for advanced coding tutorials (this is too basic for you)
- People who want theory without practice (every lab has hands-on exercises)
- Those expecting magic (you still have to do the work — just less of it)

## What You Don't Need

You don't need:

- Coding experience (seriously, none)
- Prior AI knowledge
- Expensive software subscriptions
- A computer science degree
- Perfect understanding before you start

You just need:

- A Mac or Windows computer
- An internet connection
- 20-30 minutes per lab
- A willingness to experiment and learn

## Time Commitment

Each lab takes **20-30 minutes** to complete. You can work through them:

- One per day (20 days total)
- At your own pace (skip weekends, take breaks)
- In batches by theme (5 labs at a time)
- Selectively (jump to what you need most)

The course is self-paced. Go as fast or as slow as you like.
