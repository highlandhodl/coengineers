# CoEngine User Personas

## Overview

CoEngine serves three primary user segments, each with distinct needs, behaviours, and goals. Understanding these personas helps us design features, write content, and prioritise roadmap items that serve our users brilliantly.

---

## Persona 1: Maya (The Power User)

### Quick Facts

- **Age**: 34
- **Role**: Senior Product Manager at a Series B fintech startup (London)
- **Company Size**: 85 employees, product team of 12
- **Plan**: Premium (£29/month)
- **Claude Code Usage**: 50-70 commands per day
- **Course Status**: Graduate (completed in 28 days)

### Background

Maya has been a PM for 8 years. She came from an engineering background (studied CS, worked as a developer for 3 years) before transitioning to product. She's deeply technical and loves building systems and workflows.

She discovered Claude Code 6 months ago and immediately saw the potential. "I realised I could automate 60% of my PM busywork," she says. She found CoEngineers through a Twitter thread and binged Weeks 1-3 in 10 days.

### Goals & Motivations

1. **Maximise productivity** - "If I can automate it, I should automate it"
2. **Ship faster** - Wants to move from idea to launched feature in days, not weeks
3. **Elevate her craft** - Constantly learning new methodologies and tools
4. **Influence her team** - Wants to teach engineers and designers to work this way
5. **Build a reputation** - Shares her workflows publicly, growing her personal brand

### Pain Points

1. **Complex workflows are hard to build** - Chaining commands together is manual and error-prone
2. **No team collaboration** - Can't easily share her custom commands with PMs on her team
3. **Context switching is expensive** - Jumps between Notion, Linear, Figma, Slack constantly
4. **Hard to track what works** - Doesn't know which commands she uses most or which save the most time
5. **Advanced features are underdocumented** - She's pushing boundaries and hitting gaps in docs

### Jobs to be Done

**When** I'm planning a sprint...
**I want to** quickly generate user stories from meeting notes and stakeholder input...
**So that** I can spend time refining requirements instead of drafting from scratch.

**When** I've built a powerful workflow...
**I want to** share it with my team and see how they adapt it...
**So that** the whole team benefits and I get feedback to improve it.

**When** I'm context-switching between tools...
**I want to** automate data movement (e.g., Notion → Linear, Slack → Doc)...
**So that** I stay in flow and don't lose 20 minutes to copy-paste admin.

### Features She Cares About

**Must-haves**:

- Advanced slash command library (especially Week 4 and Bonus content)
- Ability to chain commands together (workflow automation)
- Usage analytics to track command usage and time savings
- Command marketplace to browse and install community workflows

**Nice-to-haves**:

- Team features (share commands with colleagues)
- Integrations with PM tools (Notion, Linear, Figma)
- AI coach that suggests optimisations
- API access to build custom integrations

**Doesn't care about**:

- Hand-holding tutorials (she learns fast and prefers docs)
- Beginner tips and reminders (she's past that stage)
- Video content (prefers text for speed and searchability)

### How She Uses CoEngine

- Completed course in 28 days (faster than average)
- Now uses custom commands 50-70 times per day
- Active in Discord, answers questions, shares workflows
- Has created 40+ custom slash commands
- Runs Week 4 workflow (PRP → Backlog → Stories → Ship) for every feature
- Premium subscriber, evangelises CoEngine to her network

### Quotes

> "CoEngineers didn't just teach me Claude Code. It taught me a methodology for shipping faster."

> "I've automated so much PM busywork that I'm shipping 2x the features I used to, with better specs and fewer bugs."

> "The BMAD method changed how I think about product work. Brief → Map → Analyse → Deliver is now my default."

> "I wish I could share my command library with my team. They see my output and ask 'how?' but replicating my setup takes hours."

## Persona 2: Tom (The Newcomer)

### Quick Facts

- **Age**: 29
- **Role**: Marketing Manager at a SaaS startup (Manchester)
- **Company Size**: 25 employees, marketing team of 3
- **Plan**: Free (considering Premium)
- **Claude Code Usage**: 5-10 commands per day
- **Course Status**: Week 2, Day 11 (in progress)

### Background

Tom isn't technical. He studied marketing and has worked in content, social media, and now demand generation. He's always been curious about AI but found most tools intimidating.

He heard about Claude Code from a LinkedIn post and thought "this looks useful but complicated." A colleague recommended CoEngineers: "It's like having a tutor, not just a manual." That sold him.

Tom is progressing slowly (3-4 lessons per week, not daily) because he's balancing a full-time job. But he's loving it. "Week 2 has already paid for itself," he says. "I'm processing research interviews 5x faster."

### Goals & Motivations

1. **Save time on repetitive tasks** - Formatting, summarising, organising content
2. **Impress his manager** - Show that he can do more with the same resources
3. **Learn a valuable skill** - Wants to be "the AI person" on his team
4. **Avoid getting overwhelmed** - Needs simple, actionable lessons (not technical deep dives)
5. **Quick wins** - Wants to see value immediately, not in Week 4

### Pain Points

1. **Imposter syndrome** - "I'm not technical, maybe this isn't for me"
2. **Time pressure** - Hard to dedicate 30-45 min/day consistently
3. **Installation and setup friction** - Week 1 setup took him 2 hours (got stuck multiple times)
4. **Doesn't know what's possible** - Sees Claude Code as "fancy autocomplete" (doesn't grasp full potential yet)
5. **No one to ask** - Works at small company, no colleagues using Claude Code

### Jobs to be Done

**When** I have a messy research interview transcript...
**I want to** quickly extract key themes and quotes...
**So that** I can write up insights for my team without spending hours rereading.

**When** I need to write content for multiple channels...
**I want to** generate variations from a single brief...
**So that** I'm not rewriting the same thing 5 times for Twitter, LinkedIn, email, blog.

**When** I'm stuck or confused...
**I want to** get quick help without feeling stupid...
**So that** I can keep progressing and not abandon the course.

### Features He Cares About

**Must-haves**:

- Clear, beginner-friendly lessons with lots of examples
- Templates he can copy-paste and adapt quickly
- Support (email or chat) when he gets stuck
- Quick wins in Weeks 1-2 (must see value before Week 4)

**Nice-to-haves**:

- Video walkthroughs (he's a visual learner)
- Pre-built commands he can install without customising
- Success stories from non-technical users like him
- Mobile app to review lessons during commute

**Doesn't care about**:

- Advanced workflows and automation (too intimidating right now)
- Technical deep dives (engineering, APIs, etc.)
- Command marketplace (doesn't even know what that is yet)

### How He Uses CoEngine

- Progressing slowly (Day 11 after 5 weeks)
- Uses lessons as "recipes" - follows steps exactly, doesn't customise yet
- Hasn't joined Discord (too shy, worried about seeming like a beginner)
- Re-reads lessons multiple times to fully understand
- Loves Week 2 (content processing is directly useful)
- Anxious about Week 4 ("I'm not a developer, how will I code?")

### Quotes

> "I thought AI tools were for engineers. CoEngineers showed me that's not true."

> "Week 2, Day 8 (Meeting Tamer) saved me 2 hours this week alone. Already worth it."

> "I'm scared of Week 4. I don't write code. Will I be able to do it?"

> "I wish there were more templates I could just use out of the box. Customising takes me ages."

## Persona 3: Sara (The Technical Tinkerer)

### Quick Facts

- **Age**: 31
- **Role**: Data Analyst at a digital agency (Bristol)
- **Company Size**: 120 employees, data team of 6
- **Plan**: Premium (£29/month)
- **Claude Code Usage**: 20-30 commands per day
- **Course Status**: Graduate (completed in 40 days, took breaks to tinker)

### Background

Sara has a maths background and taught herself Python and SQL on the job. She loves solving puzzles and building custom solutions. She's technical but not a software engineer—more of a "tools power user."

She found Claude Code fascinating but directionless. "I could see it was powerful, but I didn't know where to start." CoEngineers gave her structure. Now she's hooked.

Sara is a tinkerer. She didn't just complete the lessons—she customised everything. "I probably spent 2 hours on Day 6 alone, tweaking my first slash command until it was perfect."

### Goals & Motivations

1. **Build custom tools** - Loves creating scripts and workflows tailored to her work
2. **Automate data processing** - Spends hours cleaning, transforming, analysing data
3. **Learn programming concepts** - Wants to become a proper developer eventually
4. **Experiment and explore** - Enjoys pushing tools to their limits
5. **Solve niche problems** - No off-the-shelf tool does exactly what she needs

### Pain Points

1. **Course moves too fast sometimes** - Wants to tinker but feels pressure to keep up
2. **Not enough advanced technical content** - Week 4 was great, wants more like it
3. **Lacks software engineering fundamentals** - Understands logic but not architecture
4. **Hard to debug complex commands** - When things break, struggles to troubleshoot
5. **Isolated** - No one at her company understands what she's building

### Jobs to be Done

**When** I receive a messy CSV or dataset...
**I want to** automatically clean, transform, and analyse it with a single command...
**So that** I can skip the tedious manual work and get straight to insights.

**When** I'm running the same multi-step process repeatedly...
**I want to** chain commands together into a single workflow...
**So that** I can execute complex analysis with one keystroke.

**When** I'm learning a new technical concept...
**I want to** see real code examples and understand how they work...
**So that** I can adapt them for my own projects.

### Features She Cares About

**Must-haves**:

- Advanced technical content (Week 4, Bonus, plus more)
- Ability to chain commands and build workflows
- Access to code examples and templates she can reverse-engineer
- Documentation that explains _how_ things work, not just _what_ they do

**Nice-to-haves**:

- API access to integrate with her own tools
- Community of technical users to learn from
- Advanced tutorials (beyond the course)
- Command versioning and git integration

**Doesn't care about**:

- Beginner content (she's past that)
- Non-technical use cases (presentations, social media, etc.)
- Premium support (prefers self-serve docs)

### How She Uses CoEngine

- Completed course in 40 days (slower than average, but by choice)
- Spent 2-3x the estimated time on each lesson, customising everything
- Active in Discord, shares her custom commands
- Has built 60+ slash commands (many highly specialised for data work)
- Uses Week 4 methodology for her own projects
- Evangelises CoEngine to data analyst colleagues

### Quotes

> "CoEngineers taught me to think like a product manager. Now I build tools the way PMs build products."

> "Week 4 blew my mind. I went from analyst to builder. I'm shipping internal tools now."

> "I wish there were more advanced courses. I've finished CoEngineers and want more technical depth."

> "The command marketplace is exciting. I have so many custom commands I'd love to share."

## How We Use These Personas

### In Product Decisions

**When prioritising features**, we ask:

- Does this serve at least 2 of 3 personas?
- Does it solve a pain point for one persona deeply?
- Does it conflict with any persona's core needs?

**Example**: Command marketplace serves Maya (shares workflows) and Sara (shares custom commands), but Tom isn't ready for it yet. We'll build it but market it to Maya/Sara specifically.

### In Content & Messaging

**When writing lessons or marketing copy**, we ask:

- Which persona is this for?
- Does the tone/complexity match that persona?
- Are we showing them outcomes they care about?

**Example**: Week 2 is written for Tom's level (accessible, clear, quick wins). Week 4 is written for Maya/Sara (technical, methodology-focused, complex outcomes).

### In Support & Success

**When helping users**, we ask:

- Which persona does this user resemble?
- What are their likely pain points and goals?
- How can we tailor our response to their level and needs?

**Example**: If a user is stuck on Week 1 setup, they're likely a Tom. We provide step-by-step help and reassurance, not just a link to docs.

---

## Anti-Personas (Who We Don't Serve)

### The "Just Give Me Prompts" User

- Wants a list of prompts, not a learning experience
- Won't invest time in structured lessons
- **Why we don't serve them**: CoEngine is about methodology, not prompt collections

### The "I Want Videos" User

- Only learns through video, won't read text
- Needs passive consumption, not active practice
- **Why we don't serve them**: Our pedagogy is hands-on and text-based

### The "I Don't Have Claude Code" User

- Wants to learn AI generally, not Claude Code specifically
- Looking for tool-agnostic training
- **Why we don't serve them**: We're opinionated about Claude Code as the best tool

### The "Free Forever" User

- Won't pay for Premium under any circumstances
- Wants everything free with no limitations
- **Why we don't serve them**: We're a business, free tier is a generous trial

## Persona Evolution

### How Personas Change

Users often move between personas as they progress:

**Tom → Sara**: As Tom gains confidence, he becomes more experimental. Some Toms become Saras by Week 3.

**Sara → Maya**: As Sara ships projects, she may transition into PM work. Saras become Mayas when they focus on workflow efficiency over technical depth.

**Tom → Maya**: Rare, but happens. A Tom who completes the course and gets hooked can become a power user within 3-6 months.

### Supporting Transitions

We design features to support growth:

- Beginner-friendly Week 1-2 (Tom comfort zone)
- Intermediate Week 3 (bridge)
- Advanced Week 4 + Bonus (Sara/Maya destination)
