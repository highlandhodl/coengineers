I want to significantly change this offer.

Given we are leading up to Xmas I want to launch this product on Monday.

I don't want to drip feed and I want to move away from

weeks and bonuses to a more concentrated theme offer, I also want to change blogs to 6 reasons that I can share on Social Media.

I love the way the learning works now with the:

- brief shell command: /Users/johngordon/Documents/code/fv-projects/coengineers/.claude/commands
- reference to common script insturctions: coengineers/.claude/SCRIPT_INSTRUCTIONS.md
- course structure: coengineers/.claude/course-structure.json

and then the specific claude.md files for each learning experience.

Getting started:

- coengineers/src/content/docs/getting-started/installation.mdx
- coengineers/src/content/docs/getting-started/introduction.mdx
- coengineers/src/content/docs/getting-started/prerequisites.mdx

Blogs becomes reasons:

- reason 1
- reason 2
- reason 3
- reason 4
- reason 5
- reason 6

The app centres around productivity using obsidain, claud code and apis.

- the core pillars are claude code allow you to
- work with the best parts of an LLM
- the best part of the OS (obsidian highlights this)
- the best part of the tools and working with external websites

 the landing page should have

- hero
- countodown
- CTA

 The learning pages should have similar but will aslo have a youtube video. Once again i want to make it more focused

 The blogs get more concise and the end up being themed around 6 reasons i can share at different times of the year.

 The CTA is to get emails which will invite people to a new prodcuty learning community in the new year. The current colour scheme is perfect but i want the oragnge to be a slightly more bitcoin orange.

 A lot of the docs and tests can be deleted initially as this is such whole sale changes that a lot of this will be completely irrelevabnt.

 The most important thing is for each theme and lab to cover an extremely similar strucutre and i love the detailed learning experience in the claude.md files at the moment so this is the most important thign to maininit. Ideally each lab would be more of a self contained unit and have to slightly adjust labs where you see fit.

 I want to completely delete the bonus content and make it really focused on

- claude code the llm
- claude code the OS driver
- claude code the external tool

- we need a simple way to connect to external apis and that's why i've left to final week

the email and resend stuff work well so no need to change this.

I don't like the company context thing at the minute and don't really need a case study thread. Ideally i don't have lots of extra docs in each lesson-modules and only have a claude.md but happy for an extra one where it makes sense. For example the templates.
